<h2>Share Drive Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#share-drive-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A Shared Drive is a shared resource on a Computer network. It is a
device or piece of information on a Computer that can be remotely
accessed from another Computer, typically via a local area network or an
enterprise intranet, transparently as if it were a resource in the local
machine.</p>
<p>The Shared Drive is the default location where the Product Server stores
all the Patches before deployment. The product asks for a Shared Drive
when Patches don’t have a locally stored Package file.</p>
<p><strong>To Setup a Shared Drive:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Log in to your Dashboard.</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Admin</strong> (accessed from <strong>Product Launcher</strong>) &gt;&gt; <strong>Shared
Drive Configurations</strong> (Patch/Package Deployment).</li>
</ol>

<ol class="arabic" start="3">
<li><p class="first">The Shared Drive Configuration page opens. Here you get the
following fields and options:</p>

</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button to make the fields editable. Once you enter
the URL, you can test the connection; the product tells you whether a
successful connection was established with the Share Drive. Once you
are done with everything, click on <strong>Update</strong> to save your changes.</p>

<div class="section" id="system-health-configuration">
<h2>System Health Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#system-health-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Patch Management ensures that all administered IT Assets are updated
with the latest Patch from the Software Vendor; this enhances security
and helps in thwarting external and internal cyber-attacks.</p>
<p>Computers fetch and deploy Patches. So it becomes imperative to monitor
all Computers to keep yourself aligned with the idea of Patch
Management.</p>
<p>Our product has a feature called System Health that flags Computers that
are missing critical, essential Patches. This helps you to manage your
vulnerability and prevent any attacks.</p>
<div class="section" id="system-health-settings">
<h3>System Health Settings<a class="headerlink" href="#system-health-settings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Go to <strong>Admin</strong> (Accessed from <strong>Product Launcher</strong>) &gt;&gt; <strong>System Health
Settings</strong> (Patch/Package Management).</p>

<img alt="figure 119" src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/admin/AD-119.png" />
</div>
<p>These settings help Flotomate to flag Computers as either Highly
Vulnerable or Vulnerable. You can filter the flagged Computers on the
<span class="xref std std-ref">Computer List View</span>. Clicking on <strong>System Health
Settings</strong> opens a page. Here you can set the conditions separately to
define Highly Vulnerable and Vulnerable.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="adf-120">
<img alt="figure 120" src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/admin/AD-120.png" />
</div>
<p>Click on <strong>Edit</strong> to make the fields editable. You are expected to enter
the minimum number of missing Patches for each severity label.</p>
<p>Each vulnerability status has a set of four severity labels and their
counts. No two same labels can have the same numbers (Numbers in Highly
Vulnerable have to be higher than Vulnerable).</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="adf-121">
<img alt="figure 121" src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/admin/AD-121.png" />
</div>
<p>The number zero in a field signifies that there’s no condition for the
corresponding severity label.</p>
<p>If a Computer has a missing Patch number that is equal to or exceeds a
minimum value for a label, then the Computer is flagged with the
corresponding health status. In case a Computer satisfies multiple
labels then the label top in the hierarchy is considered (Critical
Patches having the highest priority and Low severity having the lowest).</p>

<h2>Endpoint Scope<a class="headerlink" href="#endpoint-scope" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Depending on the License agreement you have with us, the number of
Computers you can manage with the product (for remote deployment) is
limited. All discovered Computers (with our Agent application) stay out
of the scope of the product by default; you have to bring them within
the scope before you can use our product features.</p>
<p>The Endpoint Scope lets you view all available Computers (not in the
Scope) and add them to the Scope. You can set certain conditions that
allow the product to add any new Computers automatically. You can also
add Computers manually.</p>
<p>There is a counter that shows how many Computers are within the scope
and how many you can still add. In no situation, you can exceed the
total number of Computers you are allowed to add to the Scope.</p>

<p><strong>Adding a Network (Automatic Addition of Computers)</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You can associate a Network with a Scope; this allows the Scope to
automatically add Computers (with the Agent application) in the
Network based on include and exclude conditions. You can use both
manual and automatic addition of Computers together; they are not
mutually exclusive.</li>

<div class="figure align-center" id="adf-126">

</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Once you select a Network, you now have to add conditions. The
conditions are of two types: include and exclude. Both the types
create a set of Computers from which to either include or exclude.
When there’s an intersection or conflict between the two types then
exclude conditions/condition override the include set. For example,
to add Computers within an IP range with a hostname containing “Digi”
and excluding those with Linux OS, yields the following conditions:</li>

<p><strong>Manual Adding Computers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">You can manually search and add Computers to a scope. The search bar
supports the Advanced Search feature where you get search options by
clicking on the search bar.</p>

</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>You can also enter keywords to search for a Computer. When entering a
keyword, the product explores all the Computers with the keyword in
their Name, Hostname, Domain name, OS name and Service Pack. A Computer
has to have at least one field matched (partial or full) with the
keyword; in case there are multiple keywords, a Computer has to have at
least one field matched for each keyword.</p>
<p>You can combine search options with keywords. Between two different
conditions of the same type OR logic is followed. Between different
types AND logic is observed. An example of same type contradiction is OS
Name contains Windows vs. OS Name contains Linux.</p>

<h2>Approval Settings<a class="headerlink" href="#approval-settings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The idea of Patch Management revolves around security, enhancement, and
compliance. Sometimes it may happen that specific Patches don’t comply
with the idea of Patch Management. It becomes necessary to keep these
Patches out from the IT infrastructure which might cause more trouble
than any good.</p>
<p>The tool has the provision to seek Approval for each and every Patch
before they can be deployed. There are two methods for Approval: Manual
Approval and Automatic Approval (Automatic Patch Test). Which method to
choose is decided from the Patch Approval Setting in Admin.</p>
