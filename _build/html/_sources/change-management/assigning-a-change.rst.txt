Assigning a Change
******************

Assigning a Change to a Technician makes that person responsible for the
Change. He/she becomes the point of contact for all matters related to
the Change. An assigned Technician has the privilege to initiate an
Approval process in the Approval stage.

A Technician, with the necessary rights, can assign a Change to another
Technicians or claim it for himself/herself.

**To Assign a Change:**

1. Click on **Assign** either on the :doc:`Change List
   View <change-list-view>` or Details View of a Change.

2. A popup menu opens with a search bar and a list of Technicians. The
   color ring next to the names represents the workload.
