*************************************
Submitting a Request for Change (RFC)
*************************************

Any change in the IT infrastructure can be reactive in response to
internal problems or external requirements, e.g. adverse legislative, or
proactive for seeking efficiency and effectiveness or to enable or
reflect business advantages, or for initiating programs, projects or
service improvements.

A Change in Flotomate is a multi-stage process where multiple
stakeholders are involved. The first step is to Request for Change
(RFC). An Change is submitted using the Create a Change dialog box.

To create a Change:

1. Log into your Dashboard from the Technician Portal.

2. Click on **Create** (A Navigation tab) and then click on **Change**
   from the pop-up menu.

   Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut C to open the Create
   a Change dialog box.

3. Select a Category from section-A (:numref:`cmf-2`). You can search for a
   Category using the search box. A Category can have sub-categories, up
   to 2 levels, and you can select a sub-category as well. The select
   category is highlighted in section-B.

   A Category is a way to categorize a Change. Flotomate offers six
   predefined Categories out of the box. With admin rights, you can
   modify the Category list shown in section-A.

4. Section-B (:numref:`cmf-2`) is where you select a template. When you select
   a template, specific fields of the form get auto-populated with
   predefined data. You can create templates for Changes that are
   recurring in nature. The template names appear as a drop-down list.
   Please refer to the Administration Manual to know how to add
   templates for Change.

   Following fields are changed when you select a template:

   a. The Subject line of the Change.

   b. Five classifiers (Priority, Urgency, Impact, Risk, Change Type) of
      the Change.

   c. Category of the Change.

   d. Description of the Change.

5. Name and email of the Requester are prefilled in their respective
   fields in section-C (:numref:`cmf-2`). You can add more people using their
   emails (**Add Cc Email**). They are going to receive all
   notifications received by the Requester.

6. Add the Subject line of the Change in section D (:numref:`cmf-2`). The best
   practice is to keep it short and concise, and it should convey the
   context of the Change.

   Once done with the Subject, it is time to set five classifiers of the
   change. They are as follows:

   a. Priority

   b. Urgency

   c. Impact

   d. Risk

   e. Change Type

   f. Additional Tags

      You can set the classifiers by clicking a label (except Additional
      Tags) and select a pre-defined value from a drop-down list. Learn
      more about classifiers.

      Additional Tags make your Change searchable and identifiable.

7. Enter the description of the Change in section-E (:numref:`cmf-2`). An apt
   description states the reason for the Change and how it affects the
   IT infrastructure.

8. You have to edit the following fields in section-F (:numref:`cmf-3`):

   a. **Technician Group**: A Change requires an assignee who supervises
      the Change cycle. It may happen he is working with a group of
      Technicians. The Technician Group is an explicit way to show the
      group involved with the Change

      The Technician Groups appear as a drop-down list. Learn how to
      create Technician Groups in the Administration Manual.

   b. **Location**: If the Change is taking place at a particular
      Location then you can explicitly mention the Location. Before
      adding it to the Change, you have to add the location in
      Flotomate. Learn how to add a Location from the Administration
      Manual.

   c. **Department**: If the Change is specific to a Department then you
      can explicitly mention the same.

      Learn how to add Department in Flotomate from Administration
      Manual.

   d. Under Attachments, you upload documents with the Change to assist
      the Change process.

Once you are done with the Create a Change form, hit **Create** to
initiate the Change process.
