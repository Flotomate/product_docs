=============

Status 
-------

Status show the stage of a Request, Problem, Change and an Asset in
their respective process flow. Statuses are essential in managing the
lifecycle of tickets and CIs in the Flotomate. A lot of automatic
processes can be created based on the Status of a ticket.

We have predefined Statuses for each of the ticket types and Assets.
Along with pre-defined Statuses, you can add custom Statuses.

*Note: Setting Custom Status requires administrative rights.*

Along with changing details, you can also add a note to a Request.

You create an email command tag, and you have to enclose your Request
details within the email command tags along with [[**Request** Id]] in
the subject field.

**Setting Up Email Command**:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Note: Whatever parameters you want to change, you have to have the
necessary permissions in your role.*

1. Go to **Admin** >> **Email Command Settings** (Helpdesk).

41. The Email Command Settings dialog box opens. You can change only the
    details in Available Commands of a Request. Add your email command
    in the Email Command field.

    |image115|

Figure 109

42. The Subject and Content section of the page gives you a preview of
    how to format an email to change a Request. The Request Id has to be
    in the subject section, and whatever you write in the email body,
    other than the command line, appears under collaborate in the
    Request details page(Figure 110).

|image116|

Figure 110

Request Feedback Settings
-------------------------

You can send an email to a Requestor of a Request asking for a Feedback.
The email contains a link to the feedback form. You can choose whether
to send the link with the Resolved and Closed email notification or send
it manually in a separate email.

-  Go to **Admin** >> **Request Feedback Settings** (Helpdesk).

   |image117|

Figure 111

-  You can automatically send a feedback link to a Requestor in the
   following ways:

   a. **Resolving a Request**: If you toggle the Resolved button on, a
      feedback link is sent with the email notification on Resolving a
      Request.

   b. **Closing a Request**: If you toggle the Closed button on, a
      feedback link is sent with the email notification on Closing a
      Request.

-  If you turn **Send feedback manually** button on, then you can send a
   feedback link to a Requester from the Details View of a Request.

Priority Matrix
---------------

In the product, Priority is a way to set the importance of a Request
ticket. A Technician can set the Priority of a Request manually or
automatically using the Priority Matrix feature.

**To open Priority Matrix:**

-  Go to **Admin** (A Navigation Tab) >> **Priority Matrix** (in
   Helpdesk). The Priority Matrix page opens.

   |image121|

Figure 114

The Priority Matrix is a matrix with the column head having the Urgency
values and rows having the Impact values. For example, if you want to
set the Priority for Urgency **Low** and Impact **On Department** as
**High** then you have to set the following row column value:

|image122|

Figure 115

This way you have to set the values for all row and column combinations.
The system automatically sets the Priority of a Request based on the
matrix. You can decide whether you want users to override the set
Priority using the toggle (Figure 114).

Patch/Package Deployment
========================

Patch Custom Rules
------------------

Custom rules allow you make certain things prerequisite before
performing certain activities. You can access custom rules from
**Admin** (accessed from **Product Launcher**) >> **Patch Custom Rules**
(Patch/Packages Deployment). Currently, the product offers the following
rules:

*Note: The edit button makes the fields editable.*

-  Set requirement for an Approval before publishing a Deployment
   Request.

   |image123|

Figure 116

Share Drive Configuration
-------------------------

A Shared Drive is a shared resource on a Computer network. It is a
device or piece of information on a Computer that can be remotely
accessed from another Computer, typically via a local area network or an
enterprise intranet, transparently as if it were a resource in the local
machine.

The Shared Drive is the default location where the Product Server stores
all the Patches before deployment. The product asks for a Shared Drive
when Patches don’t have a locally stored Package file.

**To Setup a Shared Drive:**

1. Log in to your Dashboard.

43. Go to **Admin** (accessed from **Product Launcher**) >> **Shared
    Drive Configurations** (Patch/Package Deployment).

    |image124|

Figure 117

44. The Shared Drive Configuration page opens. Here you get the
    following fields and options:

    |image125|

Figure 118

c. In section-A (Figure 118), you type in a URL that tells the Product
   Server the location of the Shared Drive.

d. If you want the Patches to be automatically downloaded when there’s a
   request, then turn on the toggle button in section-B.

   Click the **Edit** button to make the fields editable. Once you enter
   the URL, you can test the connection; the product tells you whether a
   successful connection was established with the Share Drive. Once you
   are done with everything, click on **Update** to save your changes.

System Health Configuration
---------------------------

Patch Management ensures that all administered IT Assets are updated
with the latest Patch from the Software Vendor; this enhances security
and helps in thwarting external and internal cyber-attacks.

Computers fetch and deploy Patches. So it becomes imperative to monitor
all Computers to keep yourself aligned with the idea of Patch
Management.

Our product has a feature called System Health that flags Computers that
are missing critical, essential Patches. This helps you to manage your
vulnerability and prevent any attacks.

System Health Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to **Admin** (Accessed from **Product Launcher**) >> **System Health
Settings** (Patch/Package Management).

|image126|

Figure

These settings help Flotomate to flag Computers as either Highly
Vulnerable or Vulnerable. You can filter the flagged Computers on the
`Computer List View <#_Filters>`__. Clicking on **System Health
Settings** opens a page. Here you can set the conditions separately to
define Highly Vulnerable and Vulnerable.

|image127|

Figure

Click on **Edit** to make the fields editable. You are expected to enter
the minimum number of missing Patches for each severity label.

Each vulnerability status has a set of four severity labels and their
counts. No two same labels can have the same numbers (Numbers in Highly
Vulnerable have to be higher than Vulnerable).

|image128|

Figure

The number zero in a field signifies that there’s no condition for the
corresponding severity label.

If a Computer has a missing Patch number that is equal to or exceeds a
minimum value for a label, then the Computer is flagged with the
corresponding health status. In case a Computer satisfies multiple
labels then the label top in the hierarchy is considered (Critical
Patches having the highest priority and Low severity having the lowest).

|image129|

Figure

Endpoint Scope
--------------

Depending on the License agreement you have with us, the number of
Computers you can manage with the product (for remote deployment) is
limited. All discovered Computers (with our Agent application) stay out
of the scope of the product by default; you have to bring them within
the scope before you can use our product features.

The Endpoint Scope lets you view all available Computers (not in the
Scope) and add them to the Scope. You can set certain conditions that
allow the product to add any new Computers automatically. You can also
add Computers manually.

There is a counter that shows how many Computers are within the scope
and how many you can still add. In no situation, you can exceed the
total number of Computers you are allowed to add to the Scope.

*Note: Only Computers configured with our Agent Application is visible
on Endpoint Scope.*

Add Computers to a Scope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Go to **Admin** (accessed from **Product Launcher**) >> **Endpoint
   Scope** (Patch/Package Management).

   |image130|

Figure

-  The Endpoint Scope page opens.

   |image131|

Figure

-  You can view the total number of Computers that you can add from the
   Total Endpoint Scope number. The Total Available shows you the number
   of Computers you can still add to reach the Total Endpoint Scope
   number.

   |image132|

Figure

**Adding a Network (Automatic Addition of Computers)**

-  You can associate a Network with a Scope; this allows the Scope to
   automatically add Computers (with the Agent application) in the
   Network based on include and exclude conditions. You can use both
   manual and automatic addition of Computers together; they are not
   mutually exclusive.

   |image133|

Figure

-  Once you select a Network, you now have to add conditions. The
   conditions are of two types: include and exclude. Both the types
   create a set of Computers from which to either include or exclude.
   When there’s an intersection or conflict between the two types then
   exclude conditions/condition override the include set. For example,
   to add Computers within an IP range with a hostname containing “Digi”
   and excluding those with Linux OS, yields the following conditions:

|image134|

|image135|

Figure

**Manual Adding Computers**

-  You can manually search and add Computers to a scope. The search bar
   supports the Advanced Search feature where you get search options by
   clicking on the search bar.

   |image136|

   |image137|

Figure

You can also enter keywords to search for a Computer. When entering a
keyword, the product explores all the Computers with the keyword in
their Name, Hostname, Domain name, OS name and Service Pack. A Computer
has to have at least one field matched (partial or full) with the
keyword; in case there are multiple keywords, a Computer has to have at
least one field matched for each keyword.

You can combine search options with keywords. Between two different
conditions of the same type OR logic is followed. Between different
types AND logic is observed. An example of same type contradiction is OS
Name contains Windows vs. OS Name contains Linux.

|image138|

Figure

-  Once you have found your Computers, add by selecting them, and they
   move to the Selected Computers list. Manually selected Computers
   override the exclude criteria/conditions set under the Network.

   |image139|

Figure

-  Once you are done setting conditions and adding Computers, click on
   **Update**.

-  You can create more than one Scope to accommodate multiple Networks
   (a Scope can have only one Network). The actual Computer list is
   cumulative of all available Scopes (added manually and
   automatically).

|image140|

Figure

Preview Computer List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you are done with adding Computers and setting conditions, you can
view the final list of all the Computers (added manually and
automatically) in all Scopes using the Preview function.

Open Endpoint Scope from **Admin**. Click on **Preview** to generate the
Computer list.

|image141|

Figure

You can search for a Computer. The search bar supports the Advanced
Search feature. It is similar to the search bar in a Scope.

Approval Settings
-----------------

The idea of Patch Management revolves around security, enhancement, and
compliance. Sometimes it may happen that specific Patches don’t comply
with the idea of Patch Management. It becomes necessary to keep these
Patches out from the IT infrastructure which might cause more trouble
than any good.

The tool has the provision to seek Approval for each and every Patch
before they can be deployed. There are two methods for Approval: Manual
Approval and Automatic Approval (Automatic Patch Test). Which method to
choose is decided from the Patch Approval Setting in Admin.

Patch Approval Setting (Selecting an Approval Method)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Note: Configuring Patch Approval Settings requires Admin rights.*

-  Go to **Admin** (accessed from **Product Launcher**) >> **Patch
   Approval Setting** (Patch/Package Deployment).

-  The Patch Approval Setting page opens. There you get three options
   (Approval Types). Click on **Edit** to make the page editable.

   |image142|

Figure

a. **All Patches Pre-Approved**: As the name suggests, all incoming
   Patches (both new and missing Patches) are Pre-Approved by default. A
   user can manually change the Approval status of Patch to Reject or
   Approved. The Automatic Patch Test doesn’t work with this selection.

   This selection comes into effect for incoming future Patches, and it
   doesn’t affect Patches that are already in the product.

e. **All Patches will be Manually Approved**: All new incoming Patches
   have the Approval status **Not Approved** by default. A user has to
   change the status manually to either Approved or Reject.

f. **Qualified Patches will be Approved by Test Task**: All new incoming
   Patches have the status **Not Approved** by default. A user can
   manually set the status. He also has the option to create a Test
   Task.

   A Test Task, also known as Automatic Patch Test, deploys a selected
   set of Patches to a specific set of Computers; if deployment is
   successful in all of the Computers, then the Patches are
   auto-approved after a set number of days. Test Task only works in
   this setting.

-  Select an Approval Type and hit **Update**.

Asset Management
================

Adding Custom Asset Types
-------------------------

We have introduced the concept of Asset Type Hierarchy to make
cataloging of Assets simple. It is a predefined catalog of Asset Types,
which serves the purpose of giving you a generic umbrella term for every
Asset in the CMDB.

|image143|\ |image144|\ |image145|

Figure 134

Flotomate allows you to add custom Asset Sub-Types in the Asset Type
Hierarchy. You can create sub-types up to two levels.

To add an Asset Type:

-  Go to **Admin** (A Navigation Tab) >> **Asset Types** (Asset
   Management).

   |image146|

Figure 135

-  The Asset Types page opens. Here you can add your sub-types in level
   two and three using the **Add** button.

**Editing Custom Types**

-  Go to **Admin** >. **Asset Types**.

-  You can change the name of any custom type using the Edit Icon or
   delete any type using the Delete Icon.

   |image147|

Figure 136

Adding an Asset Group
---------------------

Flotomate allows you to categorize Assets in the CMDB into groups.
Groups are a convenient way to compartmentalize Assets based on certain
similarities.

Some of the benefits of using Asset Groups are:

-  Asset Groups help Technicians to manage Assets in the CMDB. For
   example: if a Technician is responsible for an Asset Group called
   DATA CENTER ASSETS then he can easily search for the Assets with the
   group name.

-  Groups are used in Hardware Asset notification. For example: in case
   there is a Hardware change in a specific Asset Group then a
   notification is sent to certain users.

**To Create an Asset Group:**

*Note: This operation requires Admin rights.*

1. Go to **Admin** >> **Asset Group** (Asset Management)

45. The Asset Groups page opens. Here you can view all your Groups and
    their Assets.

    |image148|

Figure 137

*Note: You can access the Asset Groups page from Admin >> Asset Groups
(under Asset Management).*

46. Click on **Create an Asset Group** situated in the top right corner
    of the page. A dialog box opens with the following fields:

    g. **Name**: Provide a suitable name for the group.

    h. **Owner**: Select an owner of the group from the Technician list.

    i. **Description**: Write the purpose of the group.

       |image149|

Figure 138

47. When you are done hit **Create**. Your Asset Group is added to the
    Asset Groups page.

Software Type
-------------

A Software Type tries to define the nature of existence of a Software
Asset. By default, Flotomate provides six Software Types out of the box.
They are as follows:

-  **Excluded**: These are all Software that does not need any managing.

-  **Managed**: These are all Software that needs managing with regards
   to License and Compliance.

-  **Freeware**: These are Software that is free to use.

-  **Prohibited**: These are Software that is not allowed to be used.

-  **Shareware**: These are Software that is running on a free Trial.

-  **Unidentified**: As the name suggests, these are unidentified
   Software with unknown source.

Adding a Software Type:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Note: This operation requires administrative rights.*

Apart from the default Types, you can add more Software Type/Types. To
add a Software Type:

1. Go to **Admin** (A Navigation Tab) >> **Software Types** (Asset
   Management).

   |image150|

Figure 139

48. The Software Types page opens. Here you can view all your default
    and custom types. Click on **Add Software Type** situated in the top
    right corner.

    click **Add**.

Adding a Manufacturer
---------------------

Before adding a Manufacturer’s name to a Product, you have to add it in
Flotomate. In Flotomate you can maintain a list of manufacturers’ names
that you can associate with various Products in the system.

To Add a Manufacturer:

1. Go to **Admin** (A Navigation Tab) >> **Manufacturers** (Asset
   Management).

   |image152|

Figure 141

50. The Manufacturers page opens. Here you can view all the
    Manufacturers that you have added. Click on **Add Manufacturer**
    situated in the top right corner of the page.

    |image153|

Figure 142

51. The Add Manufacturer dialog box opens. Type in the Name of the
    Manufacturer and a Description, and you can maintain a record of
    sysOIDs (System OID) using the **ADD System OID** (Figure 142)
    button.

    The sysOID is for SNMP devices. The product matches SNMP devices
    with Manufacturers using the sysOID. The first 12 characters of a
    sysOID gives enough information to perform the match. The
    matchmaking happens even when the manufacturer is not explicitly
    mentioned in a SNMP device.

2. When you are done, hit **Save** to add the Manufacturer.

**Editing Manufacturer**

1. Go to **Admin** >> **Manufacturers**.

52. In the Manufacturers page, click on the Edit Icon adjacent to the
    Manufacturer that you want to edit.

53. Perform your edits in the Edit Manufacturer dialog box and hit
    **Update**.

Barcode Configuration
---------------------

You can have a variety of barcode prefixes when you are generating
barcodes for printing. In Barcode Configuration page is where you add
your own barcode prefixes.

**To Add New Barcode Prefix:**

   prefix that you want to delete. On confirmation, the prefix gets
   deleted.

Adding a Product Type
---------------------

A Product can be further categorized into Product Types. A Product Type
is a generic category to group Products. For example, Router is a
Product Type that describes Products like Asus, TP-Link, etc. In
Flotomate, you get a list of Product Types out of the box, but you can
also add more types.

**To Add a Product Type:**

1. Go to **Admin** (A Navigation Tab) >> **Product Types** (Asset
   Management).

    following fields:

    j. **Name**: Type an appropriate Type name. For example, Desktop is
       a proper Product Type name.

    k. **Type**: It is a subdivision of a Product Type. There are four
       main Types to choose from:

       lxxxii.  **Asset**: It is a thing that can provide value
                generally for more than a year. For example, a Laptop
                computer.

       lxxxiii. **Component**: It refers to a functional part of an
                Asset. For example, a GPU card is a component that goes
                into a Desktop.

       lxxxiv.  **Consumable**: It is a thing whose ability to deliver
                value gets exhausted within a short period, generally
                less than a year. For example, a Printer’s toner
                cartridge.

       lxxxv.   **Others**: Anything that doesn’t fall in the above
                three Types.

    l. **Category**: Here you have to make a selection between an IT and
       Non-IT Asset. Learn `the difference between an IT and Non-IT
       Asset <#_What_are_IT>`__.

    m. **Description**: A short description of the Product Type.

RDP Configuration
-----------------

Remote Desktop is the ability of a computer to remotely connect to
another computer and control it as if the user were in front of the
remote machine. Remote access is generally done utilizing an
application.

You can remotely connect and control workstations in the CMDB using our
Agent application. Currently, Remote Desktop works on workstations
having either Windows or Ubuntu OS and brought in by an Agent.

Turning RDP On
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can initiate a remote session, you have to turn on the RDP
from Admin:

-  Go to **Admin** >> **RDP Configuration** (Asset Management).
