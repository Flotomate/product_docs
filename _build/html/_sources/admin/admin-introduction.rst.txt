Introduction (Administration)
*****************************

We provide a standalone solution that you have to configure and
integrate with your organization to make it work.

Admin is the central hub for managing the entire product. It gives you
options to setup the product and make it a part of your organization.

Admin is responsible for configuration and reliable operation of the
product. Using Admin, an administrator seeks to ensure the performance,
resources, and security of the product while meeting the needs of the
users.

Configurations are grouped under the following heads:

-  User Management

-  Automation

-  IT Infrastructure

-  Organization

-  Customization

-  Setting up Helpdesk

-  Patch/Package Deployment

-  Asset Management

Accessing the Admin section requires Admin rights.
