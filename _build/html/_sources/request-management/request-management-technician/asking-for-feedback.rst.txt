Asking for Feedback
*******************

A Technician can ask a Requestor for feedback about his/her experience
with a Request. In taking feedback, an email is sent with a link to the
feedback form or the link is embedded in the notification emails sent
when a Request is resolved and closed.

To activate feedback:

-  Go to **Admin** >> **Request Feedback Settings** (Helpdesk).

-  You can automatically send a feedback link to a Requestor in the
   following ways:

   a. **Resolving a Request**: If you toggle the Resolved button on, a
      feedback link is sent with the email notification on Resolving a
      Request.

   b. **Closing a Request**: If you toggle the Closed button on, a
      feedback link is sent with the email notification on Closing a
      Request.

-  If you turn **Send feedback manually** button on, then you can send a
   feedback link to a Requester from the Details View of a Request.
