Mark a Request as a Spam
========================

It may happen that some Requests that you receive are irrelevant, and
you want them disappear. You can discard a Request as a Spam, and it
disappears from the product. You can mark multiple Requests as Spam at
once or mark them individually.

Asking for Feedback
===================

A Technician can ask a Requestor for feedback about his/her experience
with a Request. In taking feedback, an email is sent with a link to the
feedback form or the link is embedded in the notification emails sent
when a Request is resolved and closed.

To activate feedback:

-  Go to **Admin** >> **Request Feedback Settings** (Helpdesk).

.. _rmf-64:
.. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/request-management/RM-64.png
    :align: center
    :alt: figure 64

-  You can automatically send a feedback link to a Requestor in the
   following ways:

   a. **Resolving a Request**: If you toggle the Resolved button on, a
      feedback link is sent with the email notification on Resolving a
      Request.

   b. **Closing a Request**: If you toggle the Closed button on, a
      feedback link is sent with the email notification on Closing a
      Request.

-  If you turn **Send feedback manually** button on, then you can send a
   feedback link to a Requester from the Details View of a Request.

.. _request-bulk-update:
Bulk Update
===========

The product allows Technicians to change Request information of multiple
Requests at once.

To perform Bulk Update:

-  Go to the :ref:`Request List View <request-list-view>`.

-  Select more than one Request.

-  The **Bulk Update** button appears above the list area. Click on
   **Bulk Update,** and a dialog box opens.

    .. _rmf-68:

        :align: center
        :alt: figure 68

   You can change the following things:

        a. Change the assignee of the Requests.

        d. Modify the Technician Group.

        e. Change four :ref:`classifiers <classify-requests>` (Status, Priority,
           Urgency, and Impact).

        f. Add new tags or append to the existing ones.

        g. Change Category, Source, Department, and Location.

-  When you are done hit **Update,** and your changes are saved.

Merge Requests
==============

Sometimes two or more Requests are similar, or they are duplicates The
Merge function in Flotomate helps in dealing with duplicates and similar
Requests.

In the Merge process, one is the Primary Request, and all others are
Secondary. The outcome of a merge is always the Secondary Requests
linked to the Primary Request. If the Merge process happens between
Requests created by the same Requestor, then all the Secondary Requests
are closed, but they stay linked with the Primary Request.

Doing a Merge:
--------------

1. Log in to the Technician Portal.

2. Go to **Request** >> :ref:`Request List View <request-list-view>`.

.. _rmf-69:
.. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/request-management/RM-69.png
    :align: center
    :alt: figure 69

3. Select two or more Requests, and the **Merge** option appears over
   the list area.

.. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/request-management/RM-70.png
    :align: center
    :alt: figure 70

4. Clicking on **Merge** takes you to a new dialog box. Here you can
   choose which one to keep as Primary and which one, Secondary.
   Referring to :numref:`rmf-70`, section-A shows the Primary Request (which
   can only be one) and section-B lists the Secondary. Clicking on the
   symbol adjacent to a Request (S & P) changes a Request from Primary
   to Secondary and vice-versa.

   Section-C is the search area. You can use the search area to find
   specific Requests by using custom keywords and predefined search
   options. The Search Box works similarly to the :ref:`Search Box <searching-requests>` in List View.

   Below the Search Box is a list of other Requests. If no search filter
   is applied, then the list contains all the other Requests not
   selected for merge. Section-D allows you to select multiple Requests.
   The total number of selected Requests appears on top of the Search
   Box along with the symbol S. Click on the S symbol to add them to the
   Secondary Request area.

5. Click **Merge** once you are done with the setup. The Merge process
   closes all those Secondary Requests with the same Requestor email,
   treating them as duplicate, as in the Primary Request. Requests with
   a different email stay open.

Viewing the Relation of a Primary Request:
------------------------------------------

You can see the effect of merge under **Relations** tab in the Primary
Request’s Details View.

Deleting a Request
==================

Deleting is a bulk operation which means you can delete multiple
Requests at once.

1. Go to **Request** >> :ref:`Request List View <request-list-view>`.

2. Select a Request or Requests from the list area.

3. Click Archive, and you get a confirmation message; click **Yes** to

Announcements
=============

An announcement is a statement made to the public (Customers and
Technicians) or on a particular portal which gives information about
something that has happened or that will happen. For example: an
announcement can be made stating that the Helpdesk will be down for a
certain period.

You can run an Announcement on both Customer and Technician Portals.

   In section C, you can send the Announcement as an email to a group or
   groups. Flotomate allows you to send to both Technician and Requestor
   Groups or any one of them.

   All Announcements in Flotomate are scheduled. They begin on a start
   date at a specific time and end on an end date at a specific time. In
