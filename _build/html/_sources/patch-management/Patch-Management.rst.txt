Managing Deployment Requests
----------------------------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Deployment Request is a set of instructions for Computers (with our
Agent application). The Admin creates it, or anyone with the rights, to
initiate a deployment cycle. A Deployment Request mainly contains the
following types of information:

-  **Request details**: Defining the installation criteria.

-  **Patch details**: Selection of Patches that need deployment.

-  **Computer details**: Selection of Computers that perform deployment
   in their respective nodes.

Learn `to create a Deployment
Request <#manually-creating-a-request>`__\ .

All Computers ping the Flotomate server every hour to check for
available Deployment Requests. On finding a Deployment Request,
Computer/Computers can acquire the Patches from the Shared Drive, and
install them following a `Deployment
Policy <#manually-creating-a-request>`__. A Deployment Cycle refers to
the end to end process involving getting and installing Patches.

**Methods of Deployment**

There are three ways to create a Deployment Request in the product:

-  Manually creating a Deployment Request and publishing it.

-  Automatic Patch Deployment creates a Deployment Request (either in
   Draft or Publish).

-  Initiating an Automatic Patch Test which in turn creates and
   publishes a Deployment Request.

Manually Creating a Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Click on the Launcher icon and select **Patch**.

12. Select **Deployment Request** from the Patch menu.

    |image71|

Figure 62

13. The Deployment Requests page opens. Here you can view all available
    requests in the product. Click on **Deploy Patches** situated in the
    top right corner of the page.

14. The Create page opens. The page is divided into three sections; they
    are as follows:

    i. **Request Details**:

       |image72|

Figure 63

viii. **Name**: You can provide a name to the Patch instead of the
      default placeholder. It is advisable to keep the date part of the
      placeholder.

ix.   **Platform**: Select the platform for which you are deploying
      patch/patches. Currently, we support only Windows and Linux.

x.    **Deployment Policy**: Select a Deployment policy from the
      drop-down list. A Deployment Policy governs how the deployment of
      Patches is carried out. Learn about `Deployment
      Policies <#setting-up-a-deployment-policy>`__.

xi.   **Install After**: Provide a date and time after which the request
      tells the Computers to commence the installation process

xii.  **Expire After**: This is the date and time after which the
      request ceases to be a valid request.

j. **Select Patch**: Here you add the Patch/Patches that you want to
   deploy.

   |image73|

Figure 64

xiii. Section-A (Figure 64) is the area where you view the selected
      Patches.

xiv.  Section-B has a search bar for searching all available Patches for
      the selected platform. The search bar supports the Advanced Search
      feature. Learn how to use `Advanced Search <#AdvanceSearch>`__.

xv.   Section-C is where you view the available Patches in the product.
      Clicking a checkbox selects a Patch and transfers it to section-A.

      Select the Patches that you want to deploy.

k. **Select Target**:

   |image74|

Figure 65

Target refers to Computer/Computers where Patches are going to be
installed. You can select a Computer Group or Groups, or individual
Computers as a target. You can select both Computer Groups and Computers
as a target.

You can create a new group using the **Create Computer Group** button.
It opens a dialog box where you can create a group; learn `how to create
a group <#patch-notifications>`__. You also get a search bar to search
Computers. The search bar supports the Advanced Search feature. Learn
how to use `Advanced Search <#AdvanceSearch>`__.

Fill in all the necessary details. Now you have two options; you can
publish the request or save it as a draft.

If you save the request as a draft, then the request appears as drafted
in the Deployment Requests page. You can view all drafted requests using
the Quick Filter **Drafted**.

|image75|

Figure 66

If you want to publish the request, then click on **Publish**. This
might or might not activate the request immediately, depending on Custom
Rules. If Patch `Custom Rules <#approval>`__ demand Approval, then you
have to seek Approval before you can publish the Request.

You can publish a drafted request from its Update page (clicking on a
request opens its Update page).

Other Ways to Add a Manual Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deployment Request from the Patch List View:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Flotomate allows you to select the Patches from the List View directly
and deploy them.

-  Go to the `Patch List View <#patch-list-view>`__.

-  Select a Patch or Patches from the list area. A Deploy button appears
   above the list area.

   |image76|

Figure 67

-  Click on **Deploy,** and the Create page opens. The selected
   Patch/Patches are preselected. Complete the request and deploy. Learn
   more about creating a `Deployment
   Request <#manually-creating-a-request>`__.

Deployment Request from Patch Details View:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Go to the `Details View <#patch-details-view>`__ of the Patch that
   you want to deploy.

-  Click on the **Deploy** button situated in the top right corner of
   the page.

   |image77|

Figure 68

-  The Create page opens with the Patch preselected. Complete the
   Deployment Request. Learn more about `Deployment
   Request <#manually-creating-a-request>`__.

Adding a Deployment Request from a Computer’s Details View:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Go to the `Computer List View <#computer-list-view>`__.

-  Click on a Computer. This takes you to the Details View of the
   Computer.

-  Click on **Deploy Patches** from the **Action Menu**.

   |image78|

Figure 69

-  The Create page of Deployment Request opens. Create your request and
   publish it, or you can save it as a draft. Learn more about `creating
   Deployment Requests <#manually-creating-a-request>`__.

Approval
~~~~~~~~

In case there is a custom rule defined, then you have to make every
drafted request go through an Approval process before publishing it. In
an Approval process, you seek approval from a set of approver/approvers.

Asking for an Approval:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Go to the `Deployment Request <#manually-creating-a-request>`__ page.

-  Click on the Quick Filter **Drafted** to sort all drafted requests.

   |image79|

Figure 70

-  Select one or more requests. The **Ask for an Approval** button
   appears above the list area.

   |image80|

Figure 71

-  Click on **Ask for an Approval** to initiate the Approval process.

Different States in an Approval
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Pending:

-  Rejected:

-  Pre-Approved:

-  Approved:

Approval Process:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  First, the system checks all available Approval Workflows when an
   Approval is asked. If there are no workflows or the workflow
   conditions are not meet, then the drafted request/requests are
   Pre-Approved, and you can proceed with publishing. If there is a
   workflow/are workflows, and their conditions are met, then
   approver/approvers are auto-assigned for each request.

   When there are multiple requests, it may happen that some may trigger
   the Approval conditions and are put in Approval, and some may not
   trigger the conditions and are Pre-Approved.

   |image81|

Figure 72

-  When you **Ask for an Approval** for a request, an **Approval**
   button appears adjacent to the request. The button gives you access
   to the Approval details dialog box where you can view all the
   approvers and their comments and even re-ask for an Approval (this
   again checks for all available workflows).

   |image82|

Figure 73

For requests that have Approvers, the Approval Status changes to
Pending, and it stays there as long as the approver/approvers don’t
express a decision.

-  An approver can see his Approvals in the **My Approvals** section of
   his account.

   |image83|

Figure 74

Clicking on **My Approvals** (Figure 74) opens the My Approval page
where he can view his Approvals.

|image84|

Figure 75

Clicking on an Approval in **My Approval** opens a new page. There he
can perform the following actions:

|image85|

Figure 76

l. View request details, target Patches, and Computers.

m. Start a comment thread.

n. Approve or Reject the Approval.

-  The outcome of an Approval process is decided in two ways:

   a. **Unanimous**: All of the Approvers have to approve else the
      Approval is rejected.

   o. **Majority**: If the majority of Approvers agree then Approval is
      successful.

      In case there are multiple Approvals, the decision to go with
      unanimous or majority can be set from **Admin** (A Navigation Tab)
      >> **Approval Workflow** (Automation) >> **Approval Settings**,
      but the rights to do it lies with the Super Admin.

-  On success, the Approval moves to the Approved stage where the author
   can publish the draft. On failure, the Approval moves to the Reject
   stage where the author has to reinitiate the Approval process. The
   author reinitiates an Approval process using the **Re-Approve**
   option. A **Re-Approve** puts a request back to the pending stage.

   |image86|

Figure 77

-  Any Technician with the **Can Ignore Approval** right can ignore
   approvers and push the Approval towards the Approved stage; where he
   can publish the draft. The ignored approvers can see their Approval
   status as Ignored in Approval details dialog box of the Article.

Searching Deployment Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two broad ways to search Deployment Requests in the product:

-  Using Search Bar

-  Using Filters

|image88|

Figure 79

.. _search-bar-1:

Search Bar
^^^^^^^^^^

In the `Deployment Request <#manually-creating-a-request>`__ page you
get a search bar to search through requests. The search bar supports the
Advanced Search feature where you get a set of search options. Click on
the search bar to access all search options.

|image89|

Figure 80

In some options you have to enter a value and in others there are
predefined values. You can create conditions using multiple options.
Between two different conditions of the same option type OR logic is
followed. Between different types AND logic is observed. An example of
same option type contradiction is Platform equals Windows vs. Platform
equals Linux.

|image90|

Figure 81

.. _filters-1:

Filters
^^^^^^^

You can search for requests in the Deployment Request page using Quick
Filters. There three types of filters available:

-  Filters based on time of deployment.

-  Filters based on publishing status.

-  Filters based on origin.

|image91|

Figure 82

Section-A (Figure 82) is a quick filter to toggle across the following
views:

-  **Current**: Shows all the published and drafted requests that can
   start the deployment process immediately.

-  **Future**: Shows all the published requests that can start the
   deployment after a future date and time.

-  **Past**: Shows all the requests that have expired.

-  **Drafted**: Shows all drafted requests that are yet to be published.

-  **Archived**: Shows requests that have been deleted, includes drafted
   requests.

Section-B (Figure 82) allows you to filter request based on origin and
Approval status. There are three ways to create a Deployment Request,
and the Approval status shows both Approved and Pre-Approved requests.

-  `Approval <#approval>`__

-  `Manually <#manually-creating-a-request>`__

-  `Automatic Patch Deployment <#searching-deployment-requests>`__

-  `Automatic Patch
   Test <#automatic-patch-test-auto-approval-of-patches>`__

Managing Deployment Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deployment Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Deployment Request page, every published request has a Status
button.

|image92|

Figure 83

Using the Status button, you can check the download status of all
associated Patches of a request, and associated Computers and their
Deployment Status.

Clicking on a **Status** button opens a new page with the following
tabs:

-  **Patch Download Status**: Here you can view all involved Patches and
   their download statuses. A Patch transitions through various statuses
   during a download cycle. Some of the statuses reflect a stage, and
   some are conclusions. Altogether there are six statuses:

   |image93|

Figure 84

a. **Pending**: The Patch has been put in a queue by the Product Server
   for download. At this stage, you can cancel the process.

   |image94|

Figure 85

p. **Downloading**: The Product Server is downloading the Patch. At this
   stage, you can cancel the process.

q. **Downloaded**: The Product Server has finished downloading the
   Patch.

r. **Transferring**: The Product Server is transferring the Patch to the
   Shared Drive.

s. **Available**: The Patch is available on the Shared Drive for
   deployment.

t. **Cancelled**: A user cancelled the downloading process, or there was
   an error in downloading the Patch. You can restart the download
   process using the **Retry** button.

-  **Computers**: Here you can view all the associated Computers. Each
   computer has a **Deployment Status** button which opens a dialog box
   where you can view the installation statuses of each Patch. Computer
   transitions through various statuses when installing a Patch. Some of
   the statuses reflect a stage, and some are conclusions. Altogether
   there are six statuses:

   |image95|

Figure 86

|image96|

Figure 87

a. **Yet to Receive**: The Computer is yet to receive instructions from
   the request to install the Patch.

b. **In Progress**: The Computer is in the process of installing the
   Patch after receiving the instructions.

c. **Success**: The Computer has successfully installed the Patch.

d. **Failed**: The Computer has failed to install the Patch.

e. **Cancelled**: The request was deleted before the Computer could
   receive the instructions for installation.

f. **Not Applicable**: The Patch is not meant for the Computer.

Unsupported Computers in a Deployment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During deployment it may happen that certain target Computers don’t
support all the Patches; in that case, the Not Applicable status is
helpful.

Go to the **Status** of a request. Click on the **Deployment status** of
a Computer; there the Patches that don’t support the Computer have the
**Not Applicable** status.

|image97|

Figure 88

Edit/Archive a Deployment Request:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can update Deployment Requests that are in draft mode (both created
manually and by an automatic process). Once published, a request cannot
be edited.

-  Go to the `Deployment Request Page <#manually-creating-a-request>`__.

-  The **Status** button adjacent to a request shows that the request is
   a published request.

-  You can open a request in edit mode by clicking on it or by clicking
   the Edit icon.

   |image98|

Figure 89

**Archiving**

The product allows you to delete published and drafted Deployment
Requests. You can delete multiple requests at a time.

-  Go to the `Deployment Request <#manually-creating-a-request>`__ page
   from the Patch Menu.

-  Select one and more requests. The **Archive** button appears.

   |image99|

Figure 90

-  Click on the **Archive** button. On confirmation, the
   request/requests are deleted.

**Deleting an Active Deployment Request:**

Deleting a published request has the following effects:

-  Installation of Patches is cancelled in Computers that are yet to
   receive instructions.

-  Downloading and transfer of Patches to the Shared Drive continues
   even when the request is archived.

View Archived Deployment Requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can view an archived request along with its status. An archived
request may have partially finished operations that might need scrutiny.
To view an archived request:

-  Go to the `Deployment Request <#manually-creating-a-request>`__ page.

-  Select **Archived** from the Quick Filter section.

   |image100|

Figure 91

-  Now you can view all archived requests. Use the **Status** button to
   view `deployment status <#deployment-status>`__.

Automatic Patch Deployment
--------------------------

Deploying Patches is a recurring task that requires time and effort, and
the effort to download and deploy new Patches increases with the
increase in the number of managed IT Assets.

An Automatic Patch Deployment task helps you to download and deploy
Patches, based on a set criterion, periodically. Setting up an
auto-deployment task is a one-time activity, and you can turn it off
anytime later. You can create multiple auto-deployment tasks.

Few of the benefits of using Automatic Patch Deployment:

-  Periodic download and deployment of newly found Patches without any
   misses.

-  Schedule download of Patches at a time when the network is least
   likely to have heavy traffic.

Creating an Automatic Patch Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Go to the Flotomate **Launcher** and select **Patch**.

-  Select **Automatic Patch Deployment** from the Patch menu.

-  The Automatic Patch Deployment page opens. Here you can view all your
   existing auto-deployments tasks if any. Click on **Create Auto Deploy
   Task** situated in the top right corner of the page.

-  A new page opens with the following fields and options:

   |image102|

Figure 93

a. Section A (Figure 93) is where you provide a name to the task, select
   a `Deployment Policy <#setting-up-a-deployment-policy>`__ and a
   Platform (a single task can deploy Patches of either one platform).

b. Section B is where you select task and Patch type:

   **Task Type:**

   xvi.   Download only Approved Patch types in the `Shared
          Drive <#configuring-shared-drive>`__.

   xvii.  Download only Approved Patch types in the `Shared
          Drive <#configuring-shared-drive>`__, and create a drafted
          Deployment Request.

   xviii. Download only Approved Patch types in the `Shared
          Drive <#configuring-shared-drive>`__, and create and publish a
          Deployment Request.

          **Patch Type:**

   i.   Only consider Approved Patches that are newly added to the tool.

   ii.  Only consider Approved Patches that are
        `missing <#what-is-a-missing-patch>`__.

   iii. Only consider Approved Patches that are newly added missing.

u. Section C is where you select Computer Groups/Group where the Patches
   are going to be deployed.

-  Complete filling the fields and selecting the options. Click on
   **Create** to create your auto-deployment task.

In order to run the auto-deployment task, you have to create a schedule.

**Edit/Delete a Deployment Task**

You can open a task in edit mode by clicking on the Edit Icon adjacent
to a task. Similarly, you can delete a task using the Delete Icon.

Create an Auto-Deployment Schedule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scheduling tells the tool when to start an `auto-deployment
task <#searching-deployment-requests>`__. The outcome of an
auto-deployment task is a Pre-Approved Deployment Request for Patches
satisfying the Patch type of the task.

-  Go to the Automatic Patch Deployment Page.

-  Click on the **Schedule** button adjacent to the task for which you
   want to set a schedule.

   |image103|

Figure 94

-  A dialog box opens. Click on the **Schedule** button.

   |image104|

Figure 95

-  Set a Schedule frequency:

   *Note: Except Interval, every other option requires you to set a Time
   Zone.*

   a. **Once**: Deployment happens only once at a specific date and
      time.

   b. **Daily**: The deployment task activates on a start date & time.
      After that, the deployment happens every day at a specified time
      mentioned in the Hour and Minute field.

   c. **Weekly**: Deployment happens on a specific day/days of a week at
      a specified time.

   d. **Monthly**: Discovery happens in selected month/months of a year
      on a particular day at a specified time.

   e. **Interval**: Discovery happens after every specified minutes,
      hours, days or month.

-  An auto-deployment task generates a
   `notification <#patch-notifications>`__ whenever it creates a
   Deployment Request. Set the recipients; it can either be a Technician
   Group/Groups or an individual (email)/individuals.

-  Click on **Save Schedules** to save your settings.

You can edit the schedule settings of any task.

View Status of an Auto Patch Deployment Task
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   some are conclusions. Altogether there are six statuses:

   a. **Pending**: The Patch has been put in a queue by the Product
      Server for download.

   v. **Downloading**: The Product Server is downloading the Patch.

   w. **Downloaded**: The Product Server has finished downloading the
      Patch.

   x. **Transferring**: The Product Server is transferring the Patch to
      the Shared Drive.

   y. **Available**: The Patch is available on the Shared Drive for
      deployment.

   z. **Cancelled**: There was an error in downloading the Patch.

-  **Deployment Requests**: Here you can view all Deployment Requests
   created by the Auto Patch Deployment Task. Each request has a
   **Status** button to view its `Deployment
   Status <#deployment-status>`__.

Computer Management
-------------------

Computers are pingable IT Assets that are capable of running our Agent
application. Computers communicate with the main server (product)
through the Agent and update the main server with Patch info, and fetch
instruction for deployment (installation) of Patches.

You have complete control over Computers with respect to the following:

-  What Patches to deploy?

-  How to deploy the Patches (`Deployment
   Policy <#setting-up-a-deployment-policy>`__).

The product shows you vital info about the Computers with respect to the
following:

-  What Patches are associated with a Computer?

-  A Computer is receiving instruction from how many Deployment Request?

-  Connection status of a Computer with the main server.

Computer List View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The UI is different for Computers and Patches. We have already covered
the Patch aspect of the product. Now we are going to talk about the
Computer aspect.

The Computer aspect is made up of two types of views: the Computer List
View and Computer Details View. The Computer List View shows all the
Computers that are available in the system.

1. Log in to your Dashboard.

15. Go to **Patch** from the **Launcher**.

    |image107|

Figure 98

16. Click on All Computers from the Patch menu.

    |image108|

Figure 99

17. The Computer List View opens.

|image109|

Figure 100

-  Section A & B (Figure 100) are the search features.

-  Section C is the list area where you view all Computers. You can view
   the following information about a Computer:

   a. Computer ID is given by the Main Server.

   b. Hostname of the Computer.

   c. The OS platform of the Computer.

   d. Service Pack Details.

   e. Domain Details

   f. IP address of the Computer

-  Section D is where you can control the number of Computers visible on
   a page. You can set a default number from the Preference section.

Active Status of a Computer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tool has a marker that tells whether a Computer is active or
offline. Wherever you see Agent information in the product, you can see
the associated marker. The marker has two colours: **green** signifying
the Computer is active and communicating, and **yellow** signifying the
Computer is offline.

|image110|

|image111|

Figure 101

Searching Computers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two broad ways to search Computers in the product’s `List
View <#computer-list-view>`__:

-  Using the Search Bar

-  Using Filters

.. _search-bar-2:

Search Bar
^^^^^^^^^^

There is a search bar for searching Computers in the `Computer List
View <#computer-list-view>`__. The search bar supports the Advanced
Search feature where you get a set of search options to narrow down your
searches. You can access all the available search options by clicking on
the search box. You can build conditions using a single option or
multiple options.

|image112|

Figure 102

You can search Computers with keywords in the search field. When you
provide a keyword, Flotomate searches all the Computers with the keyword
in their Service Pack, OS Name, Domain Name, Hostname, and Name. A
Computer has to have at least one field matched (partial or full) with
the keyword; in case there are multiple keywords, the Computer has to
have at least one field matched for each keyword.

A search query can be made up of options and keywords. In any case, the
output yields Computers that satisfy all the parameters of the search
query.

Between two different conditions of the same option type OR logic is
followed. Between different types AND logic is observed. Between
keywords, and keywords and conditions AND logic is followed. An example
of same option type contradiction is OS Name contains Windows vs. OS
Name contains Linux.

.. _filters-2:

Filters
^^^^^^^

The `Computer List View <#computer-list-view>`__ has filters that allow
you to view all healthy Computers, Highly Vulnerable Computers, and
Vulnerable Computers. These filters are classifications based on
Computer health. The health of a Computer is ascertained based on the
number of missing Patches. Learn more about `Computer Health
Management <#computer-health-management>`__.

Computer’s Details View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The UI is different for Computers and Patches. We have already covered
the Patch aspect. Now we are going to talk about the Computer aspect.

The Computer aspect is made up of two types of views: the Computer List
View and Computer Details View. The Computer Details View is Computer
specific which means every Computer in the system has a Details View
that shows additional information and provides deployment options.

-  Go to the `Computer List View <#computer-list-view>`__.

-  Click on a Computer from the list area to open its Details View.

|image113|

Figure 103

-  Section-A shows the identity of the Computer. It starts with the
   Computer ID and then the Computer Name. It also shows additional
   information about the Computer. You can see the platform, OS details,
   IP address and hostname of the Computer.

-  Section-C gives you two tabs to view all related Patches and
   Deployment Requests:

   **Patches:**

   |image114|

Figure 104

Under this tab, you can view all associated Patches categories into the
following:

a. **New Patches**: Shows newly discovered Patches that are yet to be
   deployed by the Computer.

g. **Installed Patches**: Shows the Patches that have been installed by
   the Computer.

h. **Missing Patches**: Shows the Patches that are being shown as
   Installed somewhere in the system but the Computer is yet to deploy
   them.

i. **Ignored Patches**: Shows Patches that have been deemed as ignored
   for the Computer, Learn more about `Ignored
   Patches <#ignoring-a-patch>`__.

   In each category, you can use a search bar to search for Patches. The
   search bar works in the same way as the one on `Patch List
   View <#search-bar>`__.

   You can access the `Details View <#patch-details-view>`__ of a Patch
   by clicking on it.

   **Deployment Status:**

   |image115|

Figure 105

In this tab, you can view all Deployment Requests that are giving Patch
Deployment instructions to the Computer. You also view their
`statuses <#deployment-status>`__.

Computer Health Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have discussed earlier that Patch Management ensures that all
administered IT Assets are updated with the latest Patch from the
Software Vendor; this enhances security and helps in thwarting external
and internal cyber-attacks.

Computers fetch and deploy Patches. So it becomes imperative to monitor
all Computers to keep yourself aligned with the idea of Patch
Management.

Our product has a feature called System Health that flags Computers that
are missing critical, essential Patches. This helps you to manage your
vulnerability and prevent any attacks.

System Health Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go to **Admin** (A Navigation Tab) >> **System Health Settings**
(Patch/Package Management).

|image116|

Figure 106

These settings help Flotomate to flag Computers as either Highly
Vulnerable or Vulnerable. You can filter the flagged Computers on the
`Computer List View <#filters-2>`__. Clicking on **System Health
Settings** opens a page. Here you can set the conditions separately to
define Highly Vulnerable and Vulnerable.

|image117|

Figure 107

Click on **Edit** to make the fields editable. You are expected to enter
the minimum number of missing Patches for each severity label.

Each vulnerability status has a set of four severity labels and their
counts. No two same labels can have the same numbers (Numbers in Highly
Vulnerable have to be higher than Vulnerable).

|image118|

Figure 108

The number zero in a field signifies that there’s no condition for the
corresponding severity label.

If a Computer has a missing Patch number that is equal to or exceeds a
minimum value for a label, then the Computer is flagged with the
