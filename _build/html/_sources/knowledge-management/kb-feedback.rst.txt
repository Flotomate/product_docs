********

Depending on the visibility, readers can give feedback whether a
particular Article/FAQ was helpful or not by down-voting or up-voting
it. The voting option is available at the end of every published Article
and FAQ.

.. note:: A viewer can give feedback only once. After giving feedback, the
          option disappears.

The feedback score helps the system to populate the Most Helpful section
when :ref:`browsing articles <browse-articles>`.

You can view the :doc:`Feedback <browse-articles>` score while previewing an
Article/FAQ.
