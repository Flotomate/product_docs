Publishing a Drafted Article
----------------------------

to put the Article through an `Approval <#approval>`__ process before
publishing it; only the creator of an Article can put it in Approval.

Categorizing Articles/FAQs
--------------------------

You have to organize your Articles/FAQs using folders. You can create n
number of folders and manage them the way you want.

Folders give your Knowledge a structure which makes it usable. While
structuring your folders, it is essential to consider the behavior of
your audience. By behavior, we mean how your audience search for
information; do they surf or do they use a search bar.

It is a general practice to put quick reference materials on the top and
then follow a simple, meaningful structure. Avoid overcategorization to
prevent confusion among your audience.

      Approval is rejected.

   b. **Majority**: If the majority of Approvers agree then Approval is
      successful.

      In case there are multiple Approvals, the decision to go with
      unanimous or majority can be set from **Admin** (A Navigation Tab)
      >> **Approval Workflow** (Automation) >> **Approval Settings**,
      but the rights to do it lies with the Super Admin.

Keyword Based Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Knowledge Homepage, you can search for Articles/FAQs using
keywords in the search bar. When you enter a keyword in the search bar,
the product searches all Articles/FAQs with the keyword in their
content, title, Tags, Knowledge ID and attached/uploaded files.

To perform a search:

   are shown as a drop-down.

   |image36|

search bar with new keywords.

Advanced Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can narrow down your search for an Article/FAQ using predefined
search options. The search options are available in a separate dialog
box. Advance search exists in the product to help you sort your search
results and initiate multi-condition searches. It works in conjunction
with keyword-based search.

The dialog box can be accessed from `Knowledge
Homepage <#knowledge-homepage>`__ and Search Result page.

   two different conditions of the same option type OR logic is
   followed, and between different option types AND logic is followed.
   An example of conflicting conditions is **Tags equals** important vs.
   **Tags equals** critical; the result shows all Articles/FAQs with
   important and critical tags.

   *Note: The string that you enter as part of a condition is case
   sensitive.*

    Articles) using **Save as Draft** or publish directly (for FAQs).

    |image47|

Figure

15. The moment you draft the Article, the status changes to Draft and
    the Publish button appears. Refer to Figure 46.

    The original article stays published and shows that it has unsaved
    changes. You can directly publish the Article if `Custom Publish
    Rule <#custom-publish-rule>`__ is not set. Else, all your drafts
    have to go through an `Approval <#_Delete_KB_Write-Up>`__ process
    before being published.

    |image48|

Figure

*Note: You can’t put an FAQ in the draft. You have to publish any
changes directly.*

You can also put an Article/FAQ in edit mode from its preview in the
`Browse Article <#browse-articles>`__ section.

|image49|

Figure

Custom Publish Rule
-------------------

A custom rule can set the requirement for Approval whenever a drafted
Article needs publishing. In other words, once an Article enters the
draft mode, it can be published only when the Approval status is either
Pre-Approved or Approved. Learn more about `Approval in
Knowledge <#_Delete_KB_Write-Up>`__.

Feedback
--------

Depending on the visibility, readers can give feedback whether a
particular Article/FAQ was helpful or not by down-voting or up-voting
it. The voting option is available at the end of every published Article
and FAQ.

*Note: A viewer can give feedback only once. After giving feedback, the
option disappears.*

when `browsing articles <#browse-articles>`__.

You can view the `Feedback <#Folderview>`__ score while previewing an
Article/FAQ.

Collaboration in Knowledge
--------------------------

Using Sections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can divide the content of an Article into sections. Each section can
have a different author. This approach of writing eliminates all
confusions regarding who has to do what when there are multiple authors.

*Note: Adding sections is only possible in an Article.*

**Adding a Section:**

-  Open an Article in `edit mode <#editing-an-articlefaq>`__.

-  In the body area, put your cursor where you want to add a section.

-  Click on Insert Section.

   |image52|

Figure

-  Put your content within the section tags.

   |image53|

Figure

When you publish/draft an Article with sections, they become visible
next to the content.

|image54|

Figure

In conjunction with `draft <#draft>`__ and `comment <#comment>`__,
sections can make collaboration more scalable.

Draft
~~~~~

*Note: Whatever applies to an Article also applies to an FAQ.*

An Article can be written in collaboration with multiple writers using
Draft. In addition to that, dividing the content into
`sections <#using-sections>`__ can make things more manageable. For
example, a collaboration between three people (A, B & C) can play out in
the following way.

-  A starts an Article and saves it as a Draft.

   |image55|

Figure

-  The drafted Article is visible to everyone with view rights in the
   Technician Portal. B opens the drafted Article in `edit
   mode <#modifying-a-knowledge-articlefaq>`__ and makes his
   contribution, and publishes it.

-  C opens the Published Article in edit mode and makes his
   contribution, and saves it as a draft. C leaves a comment specifying
   his intention.

-  A opens the Article and sees a change in the status of the Article.

   |image56|

Figure

The text “\ **This article has unpublished changes**\ ” signifies that
someone has made changes to the document and saved it as a draft. A
reads the `comment <#_Comment>`__ and replies back, instructing C to
publish his changes. C publishes his changes after marking his comment
as resolved.
