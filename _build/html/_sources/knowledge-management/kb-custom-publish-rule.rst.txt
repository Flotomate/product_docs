Custom Publish Rule
*******************

A custom rule can set the requirement for Approval whenever a drafted
Article needs publishing. In other words, once an Article enters the
draft mode, it can be published only when the Approval status is either
Pre-Approved or Approved. Learn more about :ref:`Approval in
Knowledge <kb-approval>`.
