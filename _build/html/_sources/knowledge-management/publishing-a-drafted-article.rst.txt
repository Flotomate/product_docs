A published Article can have changes saved as a draft. You know when a
published Article has a draft when you see the status: **This article
has unpublished changes**. Clicking on **View Draft** opens the draft.

If there is a :doc:`custom rule <kb-custom-publish-rule>` set, then you have
to put the Article through an :doc:`Approval <kb-approval>` process before
publishing it; only the creator of an Article can put it in Approval.
