Using Sections
==============

You can divide the content of an Article into sections. Each section can
have a different author. This approach of writing eliminates all
confusions regarding who has to do what when there are multiple authors.

.. note:: Adding sections is only possible in an Article.

**Adding a Section:**

-  Open an Article in :doc:`edit mode <modifying-a-knowledge-article-faq>`.

-  In the body area, put your cursor where you want to add a section.

-  Click on Insert Section.

-  Put your content within the section tags.

When you publish/draft an Article with sections, they become visible
next to the content.

In conjunction with :ref:`draft <kb-draft>` and :doc:`comment <reviewing-an-article-faq>`,
sections can make collaboration more scalable.

Draft
=====

.. note:: Whatever applies to an Article also applies to an FAQ.

An Article can be written in collaboration with multiple writers using
Draft. In addition to that, dividing the content into
:ref:`sections <kb-using-sections>` can make things more manageable. For
example, a collaboration between three people (A, B & C) can play out in
the following way.

-  A starts an Article and saves it as a Draft.

    :align: center
    :alt: figure 54

-  The drafted Article is visible to everyone with view rights in the
   Technician Portal. B opens the drafted Article in :doc:`edit
   mode <modifying-a-knowledge-article-faq>` and makes his
   contribution, and publishes it.

-  C opens the Published Article in edit mode and makes his
   contribution, and saves it as a draft. C leaves a comment specifying
   his intention.

-  A opens the Article and sees a change in the status of the Article.

   The text “\ **This article has unpublished changes**\ ” signifies that
   someone has made changes to the document and saved it as a draft. A
   reads the :doc:`comment <reviewing-an-article-faq>` and replies back, instructing C to
   publish his changes. C publishes his changes after marking his comment
   as resolved.
