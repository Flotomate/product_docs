Remote Desktop is the ability of a computer to remotely connect to
another computer and control it as if the user were in front of the
remote machine. Remote access is generally done utilizing an
application.

You can remotely connect and control workstations in the CMDB using our
Agent application. Currently Remote Desktop works on workstations having
either Windows or Ubuntu OS and brought in by an Agent.

Turning RDP On
==============

Before you can initiate a remote session, you have to turn on the RDP
from Admin:

-  Go to **Admin** >> **RDP Configuration** (Asset Management).
