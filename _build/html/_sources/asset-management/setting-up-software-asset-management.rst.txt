Setting up Software Asset Management
************************************

All Assets are an instance of a Product, which means that you can add
product information to every Asset in the CMDB. A Software Asset is no
different; it is represented as a Product as well as a Component in
Flotomate because it is discovered in a machine.

A Software Asset carries specific information in the form of Software
Type, Category and Licence information.

Software Type
=============

A Software Type tries to define the nature of existence of a Software
Asset. By default, Flotomate provides six Software Types out of the box.
They are as follows:

-  **Excluded**: These are all Software that does not need any managing.

-  **Managed**: These are all Software that needs managing with regards
   to License and Compliance.

-  **Freeware**: These are Software that is free to use.

-  **Prohibited**: These are Software that is not allowed to be used.

-  **Shareware**: These are Software that is running on a free Trial.

-  **Unidentified**: As the name suggests, these are unidentified
   Software with unknown source.
