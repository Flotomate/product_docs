Package/Registry Deployment
===========================







Manage Computer Groups
----------------------

You can classify Computers into groups. Some of the use cases where
having Computer Groups can be convenient are as follows:

-  You want to deploy packages in Computers belonging to a particular
   department. You can create a Computer Group having all the Computers
   of that department and quickly create a Deployment Request with that
   group.

-  If you want to deny a specific set of Computers of packages, then you
   can create a Computer Group and decline them the packages.

**Create a Computer Group**

-  Go to the Package/Registry List View.

-  Click on **All Computers Group** from the Package menu.

   |image13|

Figure 11

-  The Computer Group page opens. Here you can view all existing groups
   if any. Click on **Create Computer Group** situated in the top right
   corner of the page.

-  A new page opens. Here you can view all the Computers added to the
   `Endpoint scope <#configuring-endpoint-scope>`__. You get options to
   select Computers manually and automatically from a Network (based on
   include and exclude conditions).

   |image14|

Figure 12

-  Provide a name to the Computer Group.

-  In whatever way you select Computers, they all become part of the
   group. The manual and automatic methods of selection are similar to
   the ones used for adding Computers to an `Endpoint
   Scope <#configuring-endpoint-scope>`__.

-  Add the Computers and click on **Create** to save the group.

-  You can review the Computer list of a group from the Computer Group
   page.

   |image15|

   |image16|

Figure 13

-  You can search a Computer Group list using a search bar (Figure 13)
   that supports Advance Search and is similar to the one used for
   searching Computers in an `Endpoint
   Scope <#configuring-endpoint-scope>`__. You can open the details of
   any Computer by click on it.

**Edit/Delete Groups**

You can edit and delete any Computer Group.

|image17|

Figure 14

View Archived Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a group is archived (delete), we store the group details in a
separate section for future reference. It is because even when a group
gets deleted, it stays active in associated Deployment Requests.

You can view all archived groups in the Computer Group page by clicking
**Archive Computer Group** button situated in the top right corner. You
can also preview the Computer list of an archived group.

Packages/Registry List View
---------------------------

The UI is divided across packages/registries and Computers. One aspect
lets you view packages & registry templates and perform related
operations, and the Computer aspect lets you view all Computers and
perform related operations.

We have the Package/Registry List View that gives a point & click
interface to manage all package/registry from a single place. The view
is divided across Windows and Linux platform.

**Viewing Package/Registry List View**

1. Log in to your Dashboard.

2. Click on the Launcher icon and select **Package**.

3. Now choose a type: either Windows Packages, Linux Packages or Windows
   Registry. Based on your selection packages/registries are shown.

|image18|

Figure 15

|image19|

Figure 16

|image20|

Figure 17

|image21|

Figure 18

Please refer to Figure 18 for the below description:

-  Section-A houses the search features.

-  Section-B is the list area where you can view all the
   packages/registries in the system. You can view the following
   information about a package/registry:

   **Packages info**:

   a. Package ID as generated by the system to identify the Package.

   b. Name of the Package.

   c. Version of the package.

   d. Package type is a system generated classification which can be
      either:

      i.   **Application Patch**: Refers to a component of a computer
           program.

      ii.  **Application**: Refers to an entire program.

      iii. **Operating System**: OS like Windows.

      iv.  **OS Component Patch**: Update patch for an OS.

      v.   **Unknown**

   e. Package Architecture which is either 64bit or 32bit.

      **Registry info**:

   a. Name of the Registry template.

   b. Description of the Registry template.

   c. The number of registry items in the template.

-  Section-C houses the option to add a new package or create a new
   registry template.

Searching Packages/Registry Templates
-------------------------------------

There are two broad ways to search in the productâ€™s `List
View <#packagesregistry-list-view>`__:

-  Using a Search Bar

-  Using Filters

Search Bar
~~~~~~~~~~

The way the search bar works is same for Windows and Linux Package List
View. The search bar in the Windows Registry view is different.

The `Package/Registry List View <#packagesregistry-list-view>`__ has a
search bar. The search bar (for Windows and Linux Package List View)
supports the Advanced Search feature where you get a set of predefined
search options to narrow down your searches. If you want to see all the
available options, then click on the search box. You can select a single
option or multiple options from the drop-down list.

|image22|

Figure 19

You can also search with keywords in the search field. When you provide
a keyword, Flotomate explores all the packages with the keyword in their
ID, Name, Description, Display Name, and Version; and for registry
templates, ID, Sub-key, Value Name, Name, and Description. A
package/template has to have at least one field matched (partial or
full) with the keyword; in case there are multiple keywords, a
package/template has to have at least one field matched for each
keyword.

The search bar in the Windows Registry List View only supports
keyword-based searches.

A search query (for packages) can be made up of pre-defined options and
keywords. In any case, the output yields packages that satisfy all the
parameters of the search query.

Between two different conditions of the same option type OR logic is
followed. Between different types AND logic is observed. Between
keywords, and keywords and conditions AND logic is followed. An example
of same option type contradiction is Package Type equals Application
Patch vs. Package Type equals Operating System.

|image23|

Figure 20

Custom Filters (Applicable on Package List Views)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can make a filter using search options and keywords and save it by
clicking on the star icon to the far left of the search bar. Saved
search filters appear along with the platform-specific filters in Figure
21. Custom filters are specific to a particular platform.

For example, a user saves a search query that filters packages with
Package Type: Application Patch and the keyword Deamon.

|image24|

|image25|

Figure 21

Filters
~~~~~~~

There are three primary filters available to sort packages and registry
templates in the product:

-  You can isolate packages for Windows and Linux, and also registry
   templates from the Package Menu. You can access the Package Menu from
   the `Launcher icon <#packagesregistry-list-view>`__.

   |image26|

Figure 22

-  In the `Package List View <#packagesregistry-list-view>`__, you can
   perform the following segregations:

   a. Segregate packages based on architecture type (32bit or 64bit).

      |image27|

Figure 23

f. Segregate packages based on Package type.

   |image28|

Figure 24

Managing Software Packages
--------------------------

The first step towards package deployment is to add Software Packages in
the system. A Package has to be manually added in the Flotomate before
it can be attached to a Deployment Request.

Whatever Packages you add, they all appear on the `Package List
View <#packagesregistry-list-view>`__ (either under Windows or Linux).
There you can modify the Package details and also delete them.

Adding a Software Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Go to the `Package/Registry List
   View <#packagesregistry-list-view>`__ (either Windows or Linux).

4. Click on the **Add Software Package** button situated in the top
   right corner.

5. The Add Software Package page opens. Here you get the following
   fields:

   |image29|

Figure 25

g. **Name (Compulsory Field)**: Here you type the name of the Package.
   The best practice is to type the name of the Software.

h. **Platform (Compulsory Field)**: Select the OS on which the package
   runs. Here you get a predefined list containing Windows and Linux.

i. **Package Type (Compulsory Field)**: You select any one of the
   options:

   vi.   **Application Patch**: Refers to a component of a computer
         program.

   vii.  **Application**: Refers to an entire program designed to
         perform a set of coordinated functions.

   viii. **Operating System**: OS like Windows.

   ix.   **OS Component Patch**: Update patch of an OS.

   x.    **Unknown**

j. **Version**: Type in the version of the Software.

k. **Vendor**: Name of the entity who created the Software Package. The
   list is populated from the Vendor Catalog.

l. **Package Architecture (Compulsory Field)**: Architecture of the
   package either 64bit or 32bit.

m. **Description**: Add a Brief explanation of the Software Package.

n. **Package Location Type (Compulsory Field)**: Here you state whether
   the location is for a Shared Drive or a Remote URL. A Share drive is
   a locally hosted storage location whereas a Remote URL points to a
   location on the Internet. A package can have only one location type.

o. **Package Locations (Compulsory Field)**: Here you type and add the
   location URL. You can add multiple URLs of the same package.

p. **Locations**: Here you can view all the location URLs added to the
   Package. You can add multiple location URLs because a Software
   Package can be made up of multiple components each having a separate
   location.

   |image30|

Figure 26

Fill in the fields and click **Add**. Now you have successfully added a
Package, and it now appears on the `Package List
View <#packagesregistry-list-view>`__.

Editing/Deleting a Software Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**To Edit a Package:**

*Note: Only Packages that are not associated with a deployment request
can be edited.*

6. Go to the `Package/Registry List
   View <#packagesregistry-list-view>`__.

1. In the list area, click on the **Edit Icon** adjacent to the package
   that you want to edit or click on the package name.

   |image31|

Figure 27

7. The Update package page opens. Make your changes and hit **Update**.

**To Delete a Package:**

*Note: Only Packages that are not associated with a deployment request
can be deleted.*

In the List Page, click on the **Delete Icon** adjacent to the Package
that you want to delete. On confirmation, the package is deleted.

Setting Up a Deployment Policy
------------------------------

A deployment policy is created to control how a Deployment Request
.actually carries out the deployment of packages/registry entries. A
user can create multiple policies and select any one of those when
creating a Deployment Request.

A Deployment Policy uses fine-grained configurations to control
deployment initiation, reboot policy, user interaction, and
notifications.

**Adding a Deployment Policy**

1. Click on the **Launcher** icon and select **Package**.

8. Select **Deployment Policy** from the Package Menu.

   |image32|

Figure 28

9. The Deployment Policies page opens. Here you can view all your
   policies that you create. Click on **Create Deployment Policy**
   situated in the top right corner of the page.

   |image33|

Figure 29

10. The Create Deployment Policy dialog box opens. You get the following
    fields:

    |image34|

Figure 30

q. **Name**: This field allows you to give a name to the policy.

r. **Apply on Every Start-up:** Checking this option makes the policy
   initiate a deployment via a request in a computer every time it boots
   up.

s. **Initiate Policy**: You can instruct Computers to install the
   packages or perform registry deployment immediately (while the system
   is running) or during a system startup.

t. **Reboot Policy**: You can instruct Computers to perform a reboot,
   shutdown or do nothing after a successful installation or deployment.

u. **Allow-user-to-skip-deployment**: Do you want to give the users of
   Computers the option to skip a deployment?

v. **Notify-user-before-deployment**: Do you want to notify the users of
   Computers before a deployment. If you select **Yes,** then two new
   fields appear where you have to add a title and a message for the
   users.

|image35|

Figure 31

Fill in the fields and click **Add** to add the policy to the list of
Deployment Policies.

**Edit a policy:**

-  Go to the `Deployment Policy <#setting-up-a-deployment-policy>`__
   page.

-  Click on the Edit Icon adjacent to the policy which you want to edit.

-  Click on **Update** after performing the edits.

**Delete a policy:**

In the Deployment Policy page, click on the Delete Icon adjacent to the
policy that you want to delete. A confirmation box opens whereby
selecting Yes deletes the policy permanently.

*Note: You cannot delete a policy if it is associated with a Deployment
Request. You have to delete the request first then the policy.*

Deployment Request
------------------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Deployment Request is a set of instructions for Computer/Computers.
The Admin creates it, or anyone with the rights, to initiate a
deployment cycle. A Deployment Request mainly contains the following
information:

-  **Request details**: Defining the installation criteria.

-  **Package details**: Installation of which Packages?

-  **Computer details**: Computers that are going to install the
   Packages.

Learn how `Deployment Requests <#adding-a-package-deployment-request>`__
are created.

All Computers ping the Flotomate server periodically to check for
available Deployment Requests. On finding a Deployment Request,
Computers/Computer can acquire the Packages from the Shared Drive or a
Remote URL, and install them following a Deployment Policy. A single end
to end process of fetching and installing/deploying Packages or registry
values is called Deployment Cycle.

Adding a Package Deployment Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently, all package deployment requests are created by users. To
create a deployment request:

11. Click on the Launcher icon and select **Package**.

12. Select **Deployment Request** from the Package menu.

    |image36|

Figure 32

13. The Deployment Requests page opens. Here you can view all available
    requests in the product. Click on **Deploy Packages** situated in
    the top right corner of the page.

14. The Create page opens. The page is divided into three sections; they
    are as follows:

    w. **Request Details**:

       |image37|

Figure 33

xi.   **Name**: You can provide a name to the Deployment Request instead
      of the default placeholder. It is advisable to keep the date part
      of the placeholder.

xii.  **Platform**: Select the platform for which you are deploying
      Package/Packages. Currently, we support only Windows and Linux.

xiii. **Deployment Policy**: Select a Deployment policy from the
      drop-down list. A Deployment Policy governs how the deployment of
      Packages is carried out. Learn about `Deployment
      Policies <#_Setting_Up_a_2>`__.

xiv.  **Install After**: Provide a date and time after which the request
      tells the Computers to commence the installation process

xv.   **Expire After**: This is the date and time after which the
      request ceases to be a valid request.

x. **Select Package**: Here you add the Package/Packages that you want
   to deploy.

   |image38|

Figure 34

xvi.   Section-A (Figure 34) is the area where you view the selected
       Packages.

xvii.  Section-B has a search bar for searching all available Packages
       for the selected OS. The search bar supports the Advanced Search
       feature. Learn how to use Advanced Search (refer to how search
       works in `Package List View <#packagesregistry-list-view>`__).

xviii. Section-C is where you view the available Packages in the main
       server. Clicking a checkbox selects a Package and transfers it to
       section-A.

       Select the Packages that you want to deploy.

y. **Select Target**:

   |image39|

Figure 35

Target refers to Computer/Computers where Packages are going to be
installed. You can select a Computer Group or Groups, or individual
Computers as a target. You can select both Computer Groups and Computers
as a target.

You can create a new group using the **Create Computer Group** button.
It opens a dialog box where you can create a group; learn `how to create
a group <#manage-computer-groups>`__. You also get a search bar to
search Computers. The search bar supports the Advanced Search feature.
Learn how to use `Advanced Search. <#packagesregistry-list-view>`__

z. **Retry Configuration**:

   |image40|

Figure 36

The retry configuration limits the number of times an Agent tries
deployment when faced with failure.

xix. You can define the maximum number of times to try deployment during
     system start-up.

xx.  You can define the maximum number of times to try deployment once
     at each refresh cycle (by default refresh cycle is set to 1 hour).

     During each retry cycle, the deployment status swings from
     In-Progress to Failed and vice-versa when all cycles fail to deploy
     the packages.

     Fill in all the necessary details. Now you have two options; you
     can publish the request or save it as a draft.

     If you save the request as a draft, then the request appears as
     drafted in the Deployment Requests page. You can view all drafted
     requests using the Quick Filter **Drafted**.

     |image41|

Figure 37

If you want to publish the request, then click on **Publish**. This
might or might not activate the request immediately, depending on Custom
Rules. If Deployment Custom Rules (refer Admin Manual) demand Approval,
then you have to seek Approval before you can publish the Request.

You can publish a drafted request from its Update page (clicking on a
request opens it in edit mode), or you can click on the publish button
adjacent to a request.

Other Ways to Add a Deployment Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding a Deployment Request from the Package/Registry List View:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our product allows you to select a Package/Packages from the List Page
directly and deploy them.

1. Go to the `Package List View <#packagesregistry-list-view>`__ of
   either Windows or Linux.

15. Select a Package or Packages from the list area. A **Deploy** button
    appears above the list area.

    |image42|

Figure 38

16. Click on **Deploy** which opens the
    `Create <#adding-a-package-deployment-request>`__ page. Use the page
    to create the request. The dialog box has the Package/Packages
    preselected.

Adding a Deployment Request from a Computerâ€™s Details Page:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Go to the Computer List Page.

17. Click on a Computer. This takes you to the Details Page.

18. Click on **Deploy Packages** from the Action Menu.

    |image43|

Figure 39

19. `Create <#adding-a-package-deployment-request>`__ page for request
    opens. Create your request and publish it, or you can save it as a
    draft.

Approval
~~~~~~~~

In case there is a custom rule (Refer admin manual for Patch Custom
Rules) defined, then you have to make every drafted request go through
an Approval process before publishing it. In an Approval process, you
seek approval from a set of approver/approvers.

Asking for an Approval:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Go to the `Deployment
   Request <#adding-a-package-deployment-request>`__ page.

-  Click on the Quick Filter **Drafted** to sort all drafted requests.

   |image44|

Figure 40

-  You can initiate an Approval process for a request by click on the
   adjacent **Ask for Approval** button.

   |image45|

Figure 41

Different States in an Approval
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Pending:

-  Rejected:

-  Pre-Approved:

-  Approved:

Approval Process:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  First, the system checks all available Approval Workflows when an
   Approval is asked. If there are no workflows or the present workflow
   conditions are not meet, then the drafted request/requests are
   Pre-Approved, and you can proceed with publishing. If there is a
   workflow/are workflows, and their conditions are met, then
   approver/approvers are auto-assigned for each request.

   When there are multiple requests, it may happen that some may trigger
   the Approval conditions and are put in Approval, and some may not
   trigger the conditions and are Pre-Approved.

   |image46|

Figure 42

-  When you **Ask for Approval** for a request, an **Approval** button
   appears adjacent to the request. The button gives you access to the
   Approval details dialog box where you can view all the approvers and
   their comments and even re-ask for an Approval (this again checks for
   all available workflows).

   |image47|

Figure 43

For requests that have Approvers, the Approval Status changes to
Pending, and it stays there as long as the approver/approvers donâ€™t
express a decision.

-  An approver can see his Approvals in the **My Approvals** section of
   his account.

   |image48|

Figure 44

Clicking on **My Approvals** (Figure 44) opens the My Approval page
where he can view his Approvals.

|image49|

Figure 45

Clicking on an Approval in **My Approval** opens a new page. There he
can perform the following actions:

|image50|

Figure 46

a. View request details, target Packages, and Computers.

a. Start a comment thread.

b. Approve or Reject the Approval.

-  The outcome of an Approval process is decided in two ways:

   a. **Unanimous**: All of the Approvers have to approve else the
      Approval is rejected.

   c. **Majority**: If the majority of Approvers agree then Approval is
      successful.

      In case there are multiple Approvals, the decision to go with
      unanimous or majority can be set from **Admin** (A Navigation Tab)
      >> **Approval Workflow** (Automation) >> **Approval Settings**,
      but the rights to do it lies with the Super Admin.

-  On success, the Approval moves to the Approved stage where the author
   can publish the draft. On failure, the Approval moves to the Reject
   stage where the author has to reinitiate the Approval process. The
   author reinitiates an Approval process using the **Re-Approve**
   option. A **Re-Approve** puts a request back to the pending stage.

   |image51|

Figure 47

-  Any Technician with the **Can Ignore Approval** right can ignore
   approvers and push the Approval towards the Approved stage; where he
   can publish the draft. The ignored approvers can see their Approval
   status as Ignored in Approval details dialog box of the Article.

   |image52|

Searching Deployment Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two broad ways to search Deployment Requests in the product:

-  Using Search Bar

-  Using Filters

|image53|

Figure 49

.. _search-bar-1:

Search Bar
^^^^^^^^^^

In the `Deployment Request <#adding-a-package-deployment-request>`__
page, you get a search bar to search through requests. The search bar
supports the Advanced Search feature where you get a set of search
options. Click on the search bar to access all search options.

|image54|

Figure 50

In some options, you have to enter a value, and in others, there are
predefined values. You can create conditions using multiple options.
Between two different conditions of the same option type OR logic is
followed. Between different types AND logic is observed. An example of
same option type contradiction is Platform equals Windows vs. Platform
equals Linux.

|image55|

Figure 51

.. _filters-1:

Filters
^^^^^^^

You can search for requests in the Deployment Request page using Quick
Filters. There three types of filters available:

-  Filters based on time of deployment.

-  Filters based on publishing status.

-  Filters based on origin.

|image56|

Figure 52

Section-A (Figure 52) is a quick filter to toggle across the following
views:

-  **Current**: Shows all the published and drafted requests that can
   start the deployment process immediately.

-  **Future**: Shows all the published requests that can start the
   deployment after a future date and time.

-  **Past**: Shows all the requests that have expired.

-  **Drafted**: Shows all drafted requests that are yet to be published.

-  **Archived**: Shows requests that have been deleted, includes drafted
   requests.

Section-B (Figure 52) allows you to filter request based on origin and
Approval status. There is one possible origin to a Deployment Request,
and the Approval status shows both Approved and Pre-Approved requests.

-  `Manually <#adding-a-package-deployment-request>`__

Managing Deployment Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deployment Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Deployment Request page, every published request has a Status
button.

|image57|

Figure 53

Using the Status button, you can check the Deployment Status of all
associated Computers.

Clicking on a **Status** button opens a new page where you can view all
associated Computers that are going to deploy the Package/Packages.

Each computer has a **Deployment Status** button which opens a dialog
box where you can view the installation statuses of each Package.
Computer transitions through various statuses when installing a Package.
Some of the statuses reflect a stage, and some are conclusions.
Altogether there are six statuses:

|image58|

Figure 54

|image59|

Figure 55

-  **Yet to Receive**: The Computer is yet to receive instructions from
   the request to install the Package.

-  **In Progress**: The Computer is in the process of installing the
   Package after receiving the instructions.

-  **Success**: The Computer has successfully installed the Package.

-  **Failed**: The Computer has failed to install the Package.

-  **Cancelled**: The request was deleted before the Computer could
   receive the instructions for installation.

-  **Not Applicable**: The Package is not meant for the Computer.

Unsupported Computers in a Deployment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During deployment it may happen that certain target Computers donâ€™t
support all the Packages; in that case, the **Not Applicable** status is
helpful.

Go to the **Status** of a request. Click on the **Deployment status** of
a Computer; there the Packages that donâ€™t support the Computer have the
**Not Applicable** status.

|image60|

Figure 56

Edit/Archive a Deployment Request:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can update Deployment Requests that are in draft mode. Once
published, a request cannot be edited.

-  Go to the `Deployment Request
   Page <#adding-a-package-deployment-request>`__.

-  The **Status** button adjacent to a request shows that the request is
   a published request.

-  You can open a request in edit mode by clicking on it or by clicking
   the Edit icon.

   |image61|

Figure 57

**Archiving**

The product allows you to delete published and drafted Deployment
Requests. You can delete multiple requests at a time.

-  Go to the `Deployment
   Request <#adding-a-package-deployment-request>`__ page from the
   Package Menu.

-  Select one and more requests. The **Archive** button appears.

   |image62|

Figure 58

-  Click on the **Archive** button. On confirmation, the
   request/requests are deleted.

**Deleting an Active Deployment Request:**

Deleting a published request has the following effects:

-  Installation of Packages is canceled in Computers that are yet to
   receive instructions.

View Archived Deployment Requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can view an archived request along with its status. An archived
request may have partially finished operations that might need scrutiny.
To view an archived request:

-  Go to the `Deployment
   Request <#adding-a-package-deployment-request>`__ page.

-  Select **Archived** from the Quick Filter section.

   |image63|

Figure 59

-  Now you can view all archived requests. Use the **Status** button to
   view `deployment status <#deployment-status>`__.

Computer Management
-------------------

Computers are pingable IT Assets that are capable of running our Agent
application. Computers communicate with the main server (product)
through the Agent and update the main server with Patch info, and fetch
instruction for deployment (installation) of Patches, Packages, and
Registry.

You have complete control over Computers with respect to the following:

-  What Packages to deploy?

-  How to deploy the Packages (`Deployment
   Policy <#setting-up-a-deployment-policy>`__).

Package Deployment shows you vital info about the Computers with respect
to the following:

-  What Packages are associated with a Computer?

-  A Computer is receiving instruction from how many Deployment Request?

-  Connection status of a Computer with the main server.

Computer List View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The UI is different for Computers and Packages. We have already covered
the Package aspect of the product. Now we are going to talk about the
Computer aspect.

The Computer aspect is made up of two types of views: the Computer List
View and Computer Details View. The Computer List View shows all the
Computers that are available in the system.

1. Log in to your Dashboard.

20. Go to **Package** from the **Launcher**.

    |image65|

Figure 61

21. Click on All Computers from the Package menu.

    |image66|

|image67|

Figure 63

-  Section A & B (Figure 63) are the `search
   features <#searching-computers>`__.

-  Section C is the list area where you view all Computers. You can view
   the following information about a Computer:

   d. Computer ID is given by the Main Server.

   e. Hostname of the Computer.

   f. The OS platform of the Computer.

   g. The architecture of the Computer.

   h. Service Pack Details.

   i. Domain Details

   j. IP address of the Computer

   k. Version of the Agent application.

-  Section D is where you can control the number of Computers visible on
   a page. You can set a default number from the Preference section.

Active Status of a Computer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tool has a marker that tells whether a Computer is active or
offline. Wherever you see Agent information in the product, you can see
the associated marker. The marker has two colours: **green** signifying
the Computer is active and communicating, and **yellow** signifying the
Computer is offline.

Searching Computers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two broad ways to search Computers in the productâ€™s `List
View <#computer-list-view>`__:

-  Using the Search Bar

-  Using Filters

.. _search-bar-2:

Search Bar
^^^^^^^^^^

There is a search bar for searching Computers in the `Computer List
View <#computer-list-view>`__. The search bar supports the Advanced
Search feature where you get a set of search options to narrow down your
searches. You can access all the available search options by clicking on
the search box. You can build conditions using a single option or
multiple options.

|image70|

Figure 65

You can search Computers with keywords in the search field. When you
provide a keyword, Flotomate searches all the Computers with the keyword
in their Service Pack, OS Name, Domain Name, Hostname, and Name. A
Computer has to have at least one field matched (partial or full) with
the keyword; in case there are multiple keywords, the Computer has to
have at least one field matched for each keyword.

A search query can be made up of options and keywords. In any case, the
output yields Computers that satisfy all the parameters of the search
query.

Between two different conditions of the same option type OR logic is
followed. Between different types AND logic is observed. Between
keywords, and keywords and conditions AND logic is followed. An example
of same option type contradiction is OS Name contains Windows vs. OS
Name contains Linux.

.. _filters-2:

Filters
^^^^^^^

The `Computer List View <#computer-list-view>`__ has filters that allow
you to view all healthy Computers, Highly Vulnerable Computers, and
Vulnerable Computers. These filters are classifications based on the
health of a Computer. The health of a Computer is ascertained based on
the number of missing Patches. Learn more about `Computer Health
Management <#computer-health-management>`__.

Computerâ€™s Details View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The UI is different for Computers and Packages. We have already covered
the Package aspect. Now we are going to talk about the Computer aspect.

The Computer aspect is made up of two types of views: the Computer List
View and Computer Details View. The Computer Details View is Computer
specific which means every Computer in the system has a Details View
that shows additional information and provides deployment options.

-  Go to the `Computer List View <#computer-list-view>`__.

-  Click on a Computer from the list area to open its Details View.

|image71|

Figure 66

-  Section-A shows the identity of the Computer. It starts with the
   Computer ID and then the Computer Name. It also shows additional
   information about the Computer. You can see the platform, OS details,
   IP address ,hostname of the Computer, Architecture, Remote Office
   details, Vendor and Domain Name

-  Section-C gives you two tabs to view all related Patches and
   Deployment Requests:

   **Patches:**

   |image72|

Figure 67

Under this tab, you can view all associated Patches categories into the
following:

b. **New Patches**: Shows newly discovered Patches that are yet to be
   deployed by the Computer.

l. **Installed Patches**: Shows the Patches that have been installed by
   the Computer.

m. **Missing Patches**: Shows the Patches that are being shown as
   Installed somewhere in the system but the Computer is yet to deploy
   them.

n. **Ignored Patches**: Shows Patches that have been deemed as ignored
   for the Computer, Learn more about `Ignored
   Patches <#_Ignoring_a_Patch_1>`__.

   In each category, you can use a search bar to search for Patches. The
   search bar works in the same way as the one on `Patch List
   View <#search-bar>`__.

   You can access the Details View of a Patch by clicking on it.

   **Deployment Status:**

   |image73|

Figure 68

In this tab, you can view all Deployment Requests that are giving
Patch/Package/Registry Deployment instructions to the Computer. You also
view their `statuses <#deployment-status>`__.

Computer Health Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have discussed earlier (in Patch Management manual) that Patch
Management ensures that all administered IT Assets are updated with the
latest Patch from the Software Vendor; this enhances security and helps
in thwarting external and internal cyber-attacks.

Computers fetch and deploy Patches. So it becomes imperative to monitor
all Computers to keep yourself aligned with the idea of Patch
Management.

Our product has a feature called System Health that flags Computers that
are missing critical, essential Patches. This helps you to manage your
vulnerability and prevent any attacks.

System Health Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go to **Admin** (A Navigation Tab) >> **System Health Settings**
(Patch/Package Management).

|image74|

Figure 69

These settings help Flotomate to flag Computers as either Highly
Vulnerable or Vulnerable. You can filter the flagged Computers on the
`Computer List View <#computer-list-view>`__. Clicking on **System
Health Settings** opens a page. Here you can set the conditions
separately to define Highly Vulnerable and Vulnerable.

|image75|

Figure 70

Click on **Edit** to make the fields editable. You are expected to enter
the minimum number of missing Patches for each severity label.

Each vulnerability status has a set of four severity labels and their
counts. No two same labels can have the same numbers (Numbers in Highly
Vulnerable have to be higher than Vulnerable).

|image76|

Figure 71

The number zero in a field signifies that thereâ€™s no condition for the
corresponding severity label.

If a Computer has a missing Patch number that is equal to or exceeds a
minimum value for a label, then the Computer is flagged with the
corresponding health status. In case a Computer satisfies multiple
labels then the label top in the hierarchy is considered (Critical
Patches having the highest priority and Low severity having the lowest).
