Introduction to Package Deployment
**********************************

What is Deployment?
===================

Deployment (in Flotomate) refers to the capability of installing and
upgrading computer programs/OS, and configure Windows Registry in a
large set of computers remotely. It is vital for managing the life-cycle
of a Computer on a large scale, and Flotomate provides a comprehensive
tool that handles all aspects of Package/Registry Deployment intuitively
and efficiently.

What is a Software Package?
===========================

A Software package may refer to:

-  **Package** (package management system), in which individual files or
   resources are packed together as a software collection that provides
   specific functionality as part of a larger system.

-  **Software suite**, which provides an organized collection of
   multiple packages, or a package consisting of multiple separate
   pieces.

Benefits of Software Package Deployment
=======================================

Some of the benefits of having Package Deployment are as follows:

-  Package Deployment updates all administered IT Assets with the latest
   Software from the Vendor; this enhances security and helps in
   thwarting external and internal cyber-attacks.

-  Helps in conserving bandwidth when a program needs to be installed in
   a large number of administered IT Assets. Software Deployment in our
   product can happen from a Shared Drive which means an Admin has to
   install a program once on the Shared Drive and the Computers fetch
   it.

-  Often new Packages come with performance improvements and new
   features. Such enhancements increase the productivity of people using
   the administered Assets.

-  Having the latest Packages for all IT Assets (workstations and
   servers) prevents unplanned breakdowns due to a Software bug.

-  The method of deployment can be controlled using a Deployment Policy.
