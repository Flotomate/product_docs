What is a Problem?
==================

It is the underlying cause of one or more Incidents. Drawing a contrast
between an Incident and Problem is essential. An Incident is a symptom
and Problem is the disease. Problem is a disruption at the level of
service infrastructure that triggers multiple Incidents for multiple
customers. The system then registers these incidents as Requests.

What is Problem Management?
===========================

It is the practice to eliminate the underlying cause of a service
failure. It involves diagnosing the Problem and validating a workaround
or permanent fix to reduce the number of incoming/recurring Incidents
and their impact on the business.

Reactive vs. Proactive Problems
===============================

1. Reactive Problems are the Problems at hand. These are known Problems
   in the system that have relationships with one or more Incidents.

2. Proactive Problems are anticipated Problems that might occur at a
   future date. They are potential causes of Incidents.
