Assigning a Problem
*******************

Assigning a Problem to a Technician makes that person responsible for
the Problem. He/she becomes the point of contact for all matters related
to the Problem. An assigned Technician has the privilege to initiate an
Approval process when required.

A Technician, with the necessary rights, can assign a Problem to another
Technician or claim it for himself/herself.

.. note:: You have to have viewing and managing rights to assign Problems.

Assigning from List Views
=========================

1. Go to **Problem** >> :ref:`Problem List View <problem-list-view>`.

2. Hover your mouse over the Problem that you want to claim or assign.
   The **Claim** and **Assign** buttons appear.

   Selecting the **Claim** button assigns the Problem to you. You can
   view your name against the Problem Subject line.

   You can assign the Problem to other Technicians. Selecting **Assign**
   pops up a list where you can see the names of other Technicians along
   with colored rings showing the workload of each Technician. Red
   represents maximum load and green, minimum load. You can also search
   for a name in the pop-up list.

Alternatively, you use **Claim** and **Assign** as a bulk operation,
which means you can **Claim** or **Assign** multiple Problems at once.
The options for this appear when you select two or more Problems.
