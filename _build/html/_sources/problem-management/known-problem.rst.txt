Known Problem
*************

Flotomate allows you to classify a Problem as known. A known Problem is
a Problem that have occurred before in the past, and the system might
have Knowledge on it. It could also be an anticipated Problem.

Making a Problem Known
======================

-  You can mark a Problem as Known by simply turning on the Known Error
   toggle in the :doc:`Create a Problem <creating-a-problem>` form.

-  You can set the **Known Error** field to Yes of an existing Problem
   from its Details View. Once a Problem is marked as Known then a Known
   Error label appears among other classifiers.
