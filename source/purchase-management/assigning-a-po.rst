Assigning a Purchase Order
**************************

Assigning a Purchase Order to a Technician (could be a Purchase Manager) makes that person responsible for
the PO. He/she becomes the point of contact for all matters related
to the PO. An assigned Technician has the privilege to initiate an
Approval process when required.

A Technician, with the necessary Purchase rights, can assign a PO to
other Technicians or claim it for himself/herself.

Assigning from Purchase List View
=================================

- Go to **Purchase** >> :ref:`Purchase List View`.

- Hover your mouse over the PO or select the one that you want to claim or assign.
  The **Assign Owner** button appear. 

  You can assign the PO to other Technicians. Selecting **Assign Owner**
  pops up a list where you can see the names of other Technicians along
  with colored rings showing the workload of each Technician. Red
  represents maximum load and green, minimum load. You can also search for a Technician.
