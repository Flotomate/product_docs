Purchase List View
******************

The Purchase interface is divided into two parts: Purchase List View and
the Purchase Details View. The Purchase List View allows **Technicians**
to track and manage all Purchases at one place.

In the Purchase List View, users get to see all the available Purchase Orders in
the system. Here a Technician can find a Purchase Order and act upon it.

**To open Purchase List View:**

A Technician clicks on the Launcher icon from the Technician Dashboard. 

Then he selects **Purchase**.
