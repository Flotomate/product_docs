Viewing Audit Trail of a Purchase Order
***************************************

The system maintains a log of changes in the form of an Audit Trail. A PO also has a Audit Trail which shows what changes have been 
made by who and when. There are two ways to view the audit trail of a PO:

**View from List View**

- Go to the :doc:`purchase-list-view`. 

- Click **View Audit Trail** from the Action Menu or you can view the Audit Trail on the Glance pane under Audit Trails tab.
