Cancelling a Purchase Order
***************************

If you don't want a Purchase Order to go ahead and still want to keep the PO details, then you have the option of cancelling it. **Cancelled**
is a defined status in the module which tells a PO is inactive but still viewable. A cancelled PO can't be un-cancelled. 

**To Cancel a PO:**

- Go to the :ref:`Details View <Open Purchase Order Details View>` of the PO that you want to cancel.

- Click on **More** and select Cancel PO from the drop-down menu.
