Purchase Order Details View
***************************

Once a Technician decides to work on a Purchase Order, he heads to the Details
View of the PO. There he/she uses the product features and
capabilities to manage the PO.

The Purchase Order Details view organizes and manages all information related
to a PO. Each PO has its own Details View having features that
Technicians use to complete a PO.
