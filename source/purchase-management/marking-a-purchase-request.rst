Marking a Request as Purchase
*****************************

Not all incoming Requests are the same. It may happen that some Requests require an assigned Technician to acquire Assets from an external
source; this is a classic case of a Purchase Request. A Technician can easily mark a Request as a Purchase Request.

Based on our :ref:`Use Case <pur-use-case>`. The Helpdesk at Fictitious Inc has already received a Request from the HR department asking for 
five laptops for their new recruits. The Request has an assigned Technician who proceeds to mark it as a Purchase Request.

**To Mark a Request as a Purchase:**

.. note:: Any Technician who has the necessary rights to update a Request can also mark a Request. 

- The assigned Technician opens the Request (:ref:`request details view`).

- The Request is marked as a Purchase Request. A label in :numref:`pur-3` shows the Request as a Purchase Request.

**Un-marking a Request:**

A Technician can un-mark a Purchase Request as a normal Request by clicking on **Un-mark a Purchase Request** 
(refer: :numref:`pur-3`)from the Action Menu.
