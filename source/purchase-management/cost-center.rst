A Cost Center is a department or a part of a department that directly adds cost to the organization and indirectly adds to profit. 
The Human Resource is a good example of a Cost Center. 

Purchase Orders are generally associated with either a Cost Center or Profit Center. A Purchase Manager can add a Cost Center to a PO.
