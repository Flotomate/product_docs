Editing Purchase Order Details
******************************

When a PO is created it is devoid of any details about the following:

- Vendor details (A PO can have only one Vendor)

- Product, quantity and price details.

- Shipping and billing Addresses.

- General information.

- Additional information

.. note:: If the PO is using a Template, certain fields are pre-populated (:ref:`Learn about the fields <Create PO Template>`)

Based on our :ref:`Use Case <pur-use-case>`. A Request was marked as a Purchase Request by a Technician. A Technician has created a PO from
the Purchase Request. Now he has to update the PO details. 

.. note:: Creating a PO from the :ref:`Purchase List View <Creating a PO from Purchase List View>`, automatically redirects the
          Technician to the Create a Purchase Order page, where he can edit the PO details.
