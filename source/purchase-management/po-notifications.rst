Purchase Order Notifications
****************************

The notification features of Purchase Management tries to establish a line of communication between five main stakeholders of a PO.
They are as follows:

- Owner of a PO (the :doc:`assigned Technician <assigning-a-po>`).

- Requester of a PO: generally he is the person who requires the Purchased Assets.

- Vendor of a PO.

- Approver/Approvers of a PO.

- User (Super Admin) of the Flotomate ITSM.

The Purchase Management module has pre-defined Notifications and also the option to send custom Notifications. Currently, there are eleven
pre-defined Notifications out of the box.

Sending a Notification
======================

A Technician can send a notification to a Vendor of a PO. To send an email:

- Go to the :ref:`Details View <Open Purchase Order Details View>` of a PO.

- Click **Email to Vendor** option in the top right corner.

- A dialog box opens where you can draft an email along with an attachment and send.
