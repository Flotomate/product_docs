GL Code
*******

GL code stands for General Ledger Code. General ledger codes are (alpha) numerals that are assigned 
to different debit or credit entries in a General Ledger to make accounting easy and functional.

A GL Code is generally associated with a PO for accounting purpose. A Purchase Manager can access all available GL codes when filling the 
details of a PO. A Purchase Template can also fill the GL code field.

.. note:: A GL Code should be appropriately matched with a Purchase Order.

An admin has to maintain a list of GL Codes in the system.
