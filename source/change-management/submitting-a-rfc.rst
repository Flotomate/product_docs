Submitting a Request for Change (RFC)
*************************************

Any change in the IT infrastructure can be reactive in response to
internal problems or external requirements, e.g. adverse legislative, or
proactive for seeking efficiency and effectiveness or to enable or
reflect business advantages, or for initiating programs, projects or
service improvements.

A Change in Flotomate is a multi-stage process where multiple
stakeholders are involved. The first step is to Request for a Change
(RFC). An Change is submitted using the **Create Change** form.

To create a Change, a technician will:

1. Log into his Dashboard from the Technician Portal.

2. Go to the Quick Actions menu (A Navigation tab) and then click on **Create Change**. The Create Change 
   form opens.

3. Select a Category from section-A (:numref:`cmf-2`). He can search for a
   Category using the search box. A Category can have sub-categories, up
   to 2 levels, and he can select a sub-category as well. The selected
   category is highlighted in section-B.

   A Category is a way to categorize a Change. Flotomate offers six
   predefined Categories out of the box. An admin can
   :ref:`modify the Category list <ad-category>` shown in section-A.

4. Section-B (:numref:`cmf-2`) is where a technician will select a template. When he selects
   a template, specific fields of the form get auto-populated with
   predefined data. He can create templates for Changes that are
   recurring in nature. The template names appear as a drop-down list.
   
   Learn how to create new :ref:`change templates <ad-templates>`.

5. Name and email of the Requester are prefilled in their respective
   fields in section-C (:numref:`cmf-2`). The technician can add more people using their
   emails (**Add Cc Email**). They are going to receive all
   notifications received by the Requester.

6. Technician will input the Subject line of the Change in section D (:numref:`cmf-2`). The best
   practice is to keep it short and concise, and it should convey the
   context of the Change.

   Once done with the Subject, it is time to set five classifiers of the
   change. They are as follows:

   a. Priority

   b. Urgency

   c. Impact

   d. Risk

   e. Change Type

   f. Additional Tags

   Technician can set the classifiers by clicking each label (except Additional
   Tags) and select a pre-defined value from a drop-down list. Learn
   more about classifiers.

   Additional Tags make the change searchable and identifiable.

7. Technician enters the description of the change in section-E (:numref:`cmf-2`). An apt
   description states the reason for the Change and how it affects the
   IT infrastructure.

8. The technician can edit following fields in section-F (:numref:`cmf-3`):

   a. **Technician Group**: A Change requires an assignee who supervises
      the Change cycle. It may happen he is working with a group of
      Technicians. The Technician Group is an explicit way to show the
      group involved with the Change.

      The Technician Groups appear as a drop-down list. Learn how to
      create :ref:`Technician Groups`.

   b. **Location**: If the Change is taking place at a particular
      Location then the technician can explicitly mention the Location. Before
      adding it to the Change, an admin has to add the locations in
      Flotomate. Learn how to add a :ref:`Location <ad-location>`.

   c. **Department**: If the Change is specific to a Department then the technician
      can explicitly mention the same.

      Learn how to add :ref:`Departments <ad-departments>`.

   d. In Attachments, technician can upload documents with the Change to assist
      the Change process.

The technician will click on **Create** once he is done.
