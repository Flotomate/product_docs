Change List View
****************

Flotomate provides an intuitive interface to manage the processes
associated with Change Management. The entire interface is divided into
Change List View and Change Details View.

The Change List View is the central hub for **Technicians** to track and
manage all Changes in the tool.

**To open Change List View, a technician will:**

1. Log in to his Dashboard from the Technician Portal.

2. Click on **Change** in the navigation section. The Change List View
   opens with the default filter set as **All Open Changes**.

Please refer to :numref:`cmf-6` for the below description:

-  Section-A, B, & C are the :doc:`search features <searching-changes>`.

-  Section-D houses the bulk-operations which are:

   a. :doc:`Bulk Update <cm-bulk-update>`

   b. :doc:`Archive <deleting-changes>`

   c. :doc:`Claim and Assign <assigning-a-change>`

-  Section-E is the list area for all the Changes in the system.
   Visibility of a Change depends on the applied filters, and the way
   Changes are shown depends on whether table view is selected or
   grid view (section-G in :numref:`cmf-6`). Regardless of the view, the
   following information is visible about a Change:

    a. Three :ref:`classifiers <classify-an-change>` which are:

        i.   The stage of the Change as Status.

        ii.  The Priority of the Change which can be modified.

        iii. The Due status of the Change which can be modified by click on
             the label.

    b. Name of the requester and create time of the Change.

    c. The subject line of the Change along with its ID.

    d. Assignee information or the **Claim** and **Assign** button. If the
       Change is closed, then the technician will see the **Reopen** button.

    e. Action menu next to **Assign** or **Reopen** houses the :doc:`View Audit Trail <viewing-audit-trail-of-a-change>` and **Open in New Tab** options.

-  Section-F is the Glance Pane (visible only in Grid View)of a Change,
   and it shows the following information:

   a. Change ID and Subject line.

   b. The entire Metadata of the Change.

   c. Requester details under **Details** tab.

   d. The **Activity** tab shows the :doc:`Audit Trail <viewing-audit-trail-of-a-change>` of the
      Change.

   e. The **Attached CI** tab lists all Assets linked to the Change.

-  Section-G is where the technician select the maximum number of Changes visible
   per page, and the view, Table View or Grid View.

    a. In Grid View, the listings are more descriptive and explicit
       compared to Table View. Technician can view additional information in the
       Glance Pane of a Changes.

    b. Table View is minimalistic which shows minimum information without
       the Glance Pane. The focus is to give the technician the most critical
       information.
