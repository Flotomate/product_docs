Change Workflow
***************

In Flotomate, a Change passes through a series of processes which we
call the Change Workflow. The processes have been grouped into five
stages, and each is might have their conditions.

The five above mentioned stages are:

-  **Submission**: At this stage, the validity of the Change is checked.
   If it is a valid change then the assigned Technician moves the Change
   forward. The following processes may take place at this stage:

   a. :doc:`Technician assignment. <assigning-a-change>`

   b. :ref:`Appointment of Change Manager <change-manager>`.

   c. :ref:`Collaboration <collaborate-schedule-and-planning>` with other
      people.

-  **Planning Stage**: At this stage, the stakeholders decide how to
   implement the Change. This is also a knowledge and information
   gathering stage. The following processes may take place:

   a. :ref:`Scheduling <collaborate-schedule-and-planning>`

   b. :ref:`Planning <collaborate-schedule-and-planning>`

   c. :ref:`Collaborate <collaborate-schedule-and-planning>`

   d. :ref:`Adding Relations <adding-relations>`

   e. Defining the Impact of the Change

-  **Approval Stage**: If the Change requires cross departmental
   approvals, then at this stage such approvals are sought. The
   :ref:`Approval <approval-in-change>` process is triggered here. On
   success, the Change moves forward.

   .. note:: A single Change can have multiple Approvals.

-  **Implementation Stage**: Planning is executed with the help of an
   Implementer. The actual change happens at this stage. The following
   processes might take place.

   a. :ref:`Appointment of Change Implementer and Change Reviewer <adding-people-to-change>`.

   b. Collaboration

   c. Adding Relations

   d. :ref:`Creating Tasks <managing-tasks>`

   e. :ref:`Time Log. <cm-time-log>`

-  **Evaluate and Close**: The implementation of the Change is audited
   by the Change Reviewer for any discrepancies. This is the last stage
   where the Change is marked as Closed if there are no discrepancies.
