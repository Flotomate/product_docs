Managing Announcements for Problems 
***********************************

An announcement is a statement made to the public (Customers and
Technicians) or on a particular portal which gives information about
something that has happened or that will happen. For example: an
announcement can be made stating that the Helpdesk will be down for a
certain period.

You can run an Announcement on both Customer and Technician Portals.
