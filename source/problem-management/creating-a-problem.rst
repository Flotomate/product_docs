Creating a Problem
******************

The purpose of creating a Problem is to minimize the adverse impact of
incidents and problems caused by errors within the IT infrastructure and
to prevent recurrence of such errors.

A Problem can be created from the Technician Portal only using the
Create a Problem dialog box. There are two to ways to access the Create
a Problem dialog box.

-  Press the letter P in your keyboard while logged in, or.

-  Click on the **Create (Plus Icon)** button from the Navigation tab and then
   select **Problem**.

.. note:: Please refer :numref:`pmf-2` & :numref:`pmf-3` for below description.

-  Section-A is where you search and add a category for the Problem. It
   is a way to categorize a Problem. Flotomate provides five predefined
   categories out of the box. Only a user with Admin rights can add more
   categories to the list.

   Each category may have sub-categories and may go down to another
   level (maximum three levels supported).

   Select a category that best describes your Problem. For example: If
   your Problem is about a faulty router the select Network as the
   category.

-  You can fill the form using a template which is a quicker way to
   create Problems that are recurring. Section-B has the field that lets
   you populate the form from a custom template.

   You can manage custom templates from **Problem Templates** (Problem
   Management) in **Admin**. Please refer the Administration Manual on
   how to add templates.

   .. note:: The person who creates Templates must have administrative
             rights.

   Loading a custom Template (if any) performs the following changes:

   a. It populates the Subject of the Problem.

   b. :ref:`Know Error. <known-problem>`

   c. Priority of the Problem.

   d. Urgency level of the Problem.

   e. Impact of the Problem on the organization.

   f. Nature of the Problem

   g. It can add Tags to the Problem.

   h. Category of the Problem.

      selected category.

-  Requestor email and name goes into their respective fields (Requestor
   Email ID and Requestor Name) in section-C. You can add other emails
   using **Add Cc Email**. This adds them to the Watcher List, which
   means they receive essential email notifications related to the
   Problem.

-  Section-D has the Subject line and classifiers. The Subject gives an
   intro to the Problem, and it is a required field.

   Status, Urgency, Impact, Nature of Problem and Tags (**Add Tags**)
   are the classifiers that you can set while creating a Problem.
   Related Topic, :ref:`Classify a Problem <classify-a-problem>`.

-  Section-E allows you to classify the Problem as
   :ref:`known <known-problem>` if you turn the toggle on.

-  Section-F is the Description area which gives a detailed explanation
   of the Problem. It should talk about the Incidents that lead to the
   creation of the Problem. Write a compelling description of the
   Problem.

   a. Due Date Time field sets a timeline for the Problem resolution;
