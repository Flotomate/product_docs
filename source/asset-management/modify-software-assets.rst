Modifying Software Assets

A Technician (refer :ref:`Technician Roles` to know about access rights) can update the Details of a Software manually, which allows
him/her to add important information relating to:

- Cost of the Software.
- License expiry info.
- License Type.
- Last audit date of the Software.
- License key details.

A Technician also has the option to merge two or more Software into one using the :ref:`Consolidation <consolidating software>` feature.

Editing Software Details
========================

Go to the :doc:`Details View <manage-asset-details>` of a
Software Asset.
