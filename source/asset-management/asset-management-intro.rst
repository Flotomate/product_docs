Asset Management
================

As modern enterprises solely rely on digital infrastructure for almost
all of their IT operations, it is critical to manage all components of
the infrastructure as per best practices. Motadata Asset Management is
designed to align with the complexity of Assets and related functions.
It empowers the IT to automate end to end asset lifecycle management,
manage CMDB (Configuration Management Database), perform automatic
discovery, generate reports, and much more.

Motadata understands the complexity that a large number of IT Assets
can bring to an organization, which is why we have built a comprehensive
Asset Management system suitable for organizations of all size.

Motadata provides a unified experience in managing and tracking of IT
and Non-IT Assets. We have features like Asset Discovery and Bulk Asset
Import for easy creation of an Asset Repository (CMDB); for complicated
Assets, we have the option of manual upload.

Our Asset Management supports extended Asset Type Hierarchy and related
properties so that you can manage almost all of the assets in the
system. Asset Type Hierarchy gives a visual cue to tell where an Asset
belongs. Another powerful visual aid is our Relationship Mapper that
builds a diagram showing all relationships originating from an Asset.

Motadata Asset Management features Product Catalogue and Vendor
Catalogue to streamline all your instances of product and vendor for
better lifecycle management and maintenance.

Software Asset Management is becoming more and more critical due to its
scale, cost and risk associated. Our Software Asset management features
Consolidation, Usage Analytics, Licence Management, Piracy detection and
much more which empower you to automate your entire IT Compliance and
governance as per your needs.

All in all, Motadata Asset Management system brings in simplicity,
scalability, and robust features so that you can efficiently manage your
IT Assets along with the cost of keeping them.

Supported Assets
----------------

Currently, we provide extensive support for IT Assets with features
mentioned above. We also offer support for Non-IT Assets with limited
features.

IT & Non-IT Assets
------------------

IT Assets are pingable Assets having an IP. For example, workstations,
printers, routers, other network devices, etc.

Non-IT Assets are non-pingable Assets like furniture, stationery,
personnel, etc.

Software Asset Management
=========================

Software Asset Management (SAM) is a business practice that involves
managing and optimizing the purchase, deployment, maintenance,
utilization, and disposal of software applications within an
organization.

Motadata Asset Management provides tools for organizations to perform
SAM effectively and efficiently. Two of the prominent features for SAM
are:

Licence & Compliance Management
-------------------------------

Motadata Asset Management allows you to add and manage multiple
Software Licenses. You can view all your Licenses at one place and even
get notifications when they are about to expire.

You can set notifications when a license is under or over-utilized so
that you can manage compliance as well as your budget.

Software Metering
-----------------

Motadata tracks three critical data of all Software in the Asset
repository: usage statistics of an Asset, total usage time in minutes
and elapsed time since last used. Such data directly helps you to track
the usability of a Software, and it can be coupled with other data to
make exciting discoveries.
