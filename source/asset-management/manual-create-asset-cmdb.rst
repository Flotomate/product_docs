.. note:: Please refer to :numref:`amf-86` for the below description.

Two things are compulsory when creating an Asset: Name of the Asset and
Asset Type. The Asset that you are adding must have a type which is
present in the Asset Type Hierarchy. So before you add any Asset, you
must have a Name and an Asset Type for each of your Assets.

-  Section-A has the search bar that lets you search an Asset Type in
   the Asset Type Hierarchy. The found types are shown below in
   section-B.

-  Section-B gives you access to the entire Asset Type Hierarchy when
   thereâ€™s no keyword in the search bar above. You can view all the
   sub-types by clicking a Parent Category. There are five Parent
   Categories to select from:

   a. **Services**: This category houses Non-IT Asset Types.

   b. **Cloud**: This category houses Assets related to cloud hosting.

   c. **Software**: All Software Assets come in this category.

   d. **Hardware**: This category contains all physical, pingable IT
      Assets.

   e. **Others**: This category includes both IT and Non-IT Assets.

-  You put the display name in the Name field in section-C. This is a
   required field. The product shows an Asset by this name.

-  In section-D, you select the name of the Technician who is managing
   the Asset. Clicking on the field gives you a list of all the
   available Technicians in the system.

-  In section-E, you select the Location of the Asset from a drop-down
   list.

-  In section-F, you can perform three operations:

   a. **Status**: Here you can set a status for the Asset. Learn more
      about predefined and custom statuses.

   b. **Impact**: You can specify the impact as either Low, Self,
      Department or Business.

   c. **Tag**: You can add a custom tag to the Asset.

-  In section-H, you put the Barcode ID which is a sequence of
   alpha-numeric characters not more than 15 characters.

-  Whatever Asset Type that you select, it is shown in section-I.

-  In section-J, you put the email address of the person who is using
   the Asset.

-  In section-K, you select an Asset Group. This is a way to categorize
   the Asset. Learn more about :ref:`creating Asset Groups <managing asset groups>`.

-  You select the Department where the Asset belongs from a drop-down
   list in section-J.

-  You give a brief description of the Asset in the Description field.

-  You can upload files as attachments with the Asset by using the
   Attach File button. For example, you can upload the invoice of the
   Asset.

4. Type in the Details and hit **Add** to create the Asset.
