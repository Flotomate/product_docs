Viewing Audit Trail
===================

An Audit Trail provides an active log of changes made to an Asset in a
CMDB with timestamp and info about the user responsible for the change.
This is a tracking feature that allows monitoring of Techniciansâ€™
activities in relation to an Asset.

You can view the Audit Trail in the following ways:

-  **History Tab**: You can view the Audit Trail in the History tab (in
   `Asset Details View <#searching-assets>`__) of a Hardware, Service,
   Cloud and Other Asset types.

   Menu of an Asset in the `Asset List View <#searching-assets>`__.

Change and Scan Log
===================

Asset types other than Software provide two important logs; you can find
them in **History** tab on the `Details
View <#understanding-asset-details>`__ of an Asset, they are:

-  **Scan Log**: Here you can view the number of times the Asset was
   scanned along with timestamp and the mode of scan.

-  **Change Log**: During a Polling process, Assets in the CMDB are
   updated for changes in Software and Hardware. A Change log lists the
   discrepancies between a source (Asset in network) and a destination
   (Asset in CMDB). For example: a new addition of a software to an
   already discovered Asset gets reflected in the Change Log during
   polling.
