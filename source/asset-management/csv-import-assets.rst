**********************************
Importing Assets in Bulk Using CSV
**********************************

Flotomate allows you to import Assets in bulk using a CSV file. The CSV
file has to be created in a particular format for this feature to work.

A CSV file allows data to be represented in a tabular structure with
each row having a string of values separated by commas. When you upload
a CSV file into the system, it treats the first row of the file as the
header containing Asset Property names, and each subsequent row as an
Asset with property values. The CSV file cannot have a mixture of
different Asset Types; it should contain information about a single
type.

Apart from uploading Assets, a CSV file can also be used to update
existing Assets. The process of updating and importing is the same; the
only difference being you upload the same file again with new values.

**To Upload Bulk Assets using CSV:**

1. Go to the :doc:`Asset List View<asset-list-view>`.

2. Click on the Action Menu situated in the top right corner of the
    page. Select **Import Asset** from the pop-up menu.

3. The Import page opens. You have to go through four stages before
    adding Assets.

    a. **Select File**: Here you have to select an Asset Type, Date
       format, and the CSV file for upload.

            :align: center

       Clicking on Asset Type opens the Asset Type Hierarchy from where you
       make a selection. If your document contains date, then you have to
       specify the date format in the Date Format field. Upload the CSV file
       from your PC.

       Custom Asset Types also appear in this section (in the Asset Type field). Learn how to create :doc:`Custom Asset Type <admin-asset-management>`
       (head to Asset Type)

       After finishing this section, click **Next**.

    b. **Column Mapping**: Every item in the first row (heading) is a name
       of an Asset Property. The system automatically matches the names in
       the file heading with all the property names in the system.

        .. _amf-90:
        .. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/asset-management/AM-90.png
            :align: center
            :alt: figure 90

      In the above figure, the left-hand side shows all property names under
      three categories: CI Details, Computer Property Details (shown in
      Computer Asset Type and its child types), and Hardware Property Details
      (shown in Hardware and Computer Asset Type, and their child types). The
      right-hand side shows all the matched names present in the heading of
      the file.

      In case an Asset Property does not have a match, the right-hand side
      field of the name remains empty. Here you have to manually match the
      item by clicking on the field and selecting from a list of all other
      header values in the file.

            :align: center

      It is not necessary that all the property field names have to have a
      match; you can still upload your Assets. Click **Next** to continue to
      the next step.

      You can add additional property names using custom fields. Whatever custom fields you add appear as column property names.
      Learn how to add :doc:`Custom Fields <admin-customization>` (head to Custom Fields).

    c. **Unmatched Value Mapping**: The given property names in the header
       have values (rows). The system checks for property values that arenâ€™t
       in the system.

        .. _amf-93:
        .. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/asset-management/AM-93.png
            :align: center
            :alt: figure 93

       You can manually assign a value from the Possible Values (system values)
       to an Unmatched Value (value in the file).

       You have to match all values (under all property names) else you cannot
       proceed further. Click **Next** to continue to the next step.

    d. **Review**: Here you can review the following information:

        i.  Asset Type

        ii. Selected Date format

        iii.  CSV file name

        iv.   The number of Assets that are going to be imported

    e. In the Review section, click on **Import** to begin the Import
       process. When the import process ends, the system shows whether the
       import was successful or not.
