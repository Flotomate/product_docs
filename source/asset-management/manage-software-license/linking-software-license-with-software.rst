Associating a Software License with a Software Asset
****************************************************

.. note:: Here a Software Asset refers to any Asset having an Asset Type as
          Software or any sub-type of Software.

The functional aspect of having a Software License in Flotomate starts
with linking the License with a Software Asset which has the same Product
Type as the License.

After we are done :ref:`Creating a License`, we are going to link it with a Software Asset. We can know whether a License is
associated with a Software Asset from the Details View of the License.

.. note:: A License can be associated with only one Software Asset.

**To make an association:**

1. Go to **Asset** (A Navigation Tab) >> :doc:`Asset List View <asset-list-view>` of Software Assets.

2. Select a Software Asset with the same :ref:`Product <am-product>` as the License
   and open its Details View.

3. The **License** tab only appears when the Software Type is set to **Managed**. 
   Change the Software Type to **Managed** from the **More Details** section if you do not see the **License** tab under **Details**.

4. The **License** tab shows the associated License if any. In the
   **License** tab, click on the **Associate License** button.

5. The **Associate License with software** dialog box opens. Here you
   can view all un-associated Licenses. You can search for available
   Licenses using the search bar using search options. Click the search
   bar to access the search options.

6. Select a License and click **Associate Selected License**. The
   License is added to the **License** tab of the Asset.
