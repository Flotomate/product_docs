Update License Details
**********************

A Software License holds vital information that forms the basis for compliance management. 
Flotomate ITSM tool allows users to manage such information from the Details View of a License.

Every License in our tool has a Details View that houses licence related information. 
You are taken to the Details View after adding a License in the system, but that does not mean you cannot access
the Details View anytime later.

Accessing the Details View of a License
=======================================

1. Go to **Asset** (A Navigation Tab) >> **Software Licenses**.

Updating License Name and Description.
======================================

Once a License is created, a user can later update the Name and Description of the Licence from its :ref:`Details View <Accessing the Details View of a License>`. 
The Name of a Licence is always accompanied by a Licence ID which is not editable. 

**To Edit Name and Description:**

-  Click on the Edit Icon next to the Name.

Updating License Details
========================

The bulk of the information about the License is stored in the Details
tab (refer :numref:`amf-131`) across five heads: **License Info**,
**Ownership**, **License File**, **Invoice**, and **Purchase Order**.

Clicking on the **Details** tab makes the five heads visible (refer :numref:`amf-131`). Clicking on a head shows the available fields.
Each head has an Edit Icon that you can use to edit the fields.
