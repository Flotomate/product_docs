Adding a License 
================

The first step towards managing a License is to add the License to the Software License management tool. Creating a License
requires minimum information and involves the following process:

1. Go to **Asset** (A Navigation Tab) >> **Software Licenses**.

3. The Add Software License dialog box appears with the following fields:

    a. **Name**: A Proper name should identify the association of the
       License with a Software.

    b. **Product Name**: This refers to the Product for which the
       License is meant.

    c. **Version**: Type in the version of the License. This can be a
       user define or something mentioned in the License Agreement.

    d. **License Type**: Learn more about the :ref:`License Types <understanding the license types>`.

    e. **Description**: A short description of the License.

4. Type in the details and hit **Add**. You are taken to the License
   Details View where you can add additional information about the
   License.

After we are done creating the License, we are going to link it with a Software Asset (:ref:`Learn More <Associating a Software License with a Software Asset>`)
