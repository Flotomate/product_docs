Relate a Purchase Order in License
**********************************

License can by purchased through a purchase order as part of a software, and all purchase orders are managed from the purchase module.
We have the option that allows users to relate a license with its associated purchase order. Follow the following steps to link a license with
a po:

- Go to **Asset** >>  **Software License**.

- Open a license from the Software License page. 

- In the details page of the PO, you will find the Relations tab. Here you can perform two operations:

  a. Create a new PO and relate the same with the License.

  b. Relate an existing PO with the license. 

  Here you can also view any existing related PO.
