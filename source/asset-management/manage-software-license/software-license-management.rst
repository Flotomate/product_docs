Software License Management
***************************

A Software License is an instrument that governs the use and
redistribution of the Software. It exists in the form of an agreement
between the Software Vendor and the purchaser of the Software. The
License agreement is referred to as **End User License Agreement** and
contains information like expire date of the License, terms and
condition of usage, and redistribution clause.

Managing Software Licenses is vital for an organization to stay
compliant. Some of the benefits of having Software License Management are as follows:

- Proper license management prevents non-compliance, which in turn prevents legal complications.

- The organization can know its financial liability towards Software licenses.

- It can track the usage of licensed programs, which in turn can save money. It enables the organization to buy what is required.

- It Reduces security risks to the IT infrastructure as Licensed Software have support from their Vendors through security updates.

We have a robust Software License management tool that aims to streamline all related processes. Using our tool, you can
manage License usage, track compliance violation and receive compliance related notifications.

Understanding the License Types
===============================

We support ten types of Licenses out of the box. They are as follows:

-  **Single Machine**: Also referred to as Single User License. This
   type of License grants a single user to use the Software either on a
   single machine or multiple machines. Motadata automatically sets the
   Purchase Count for this type to one.

-  **Multiple Machine**: This type of License grants multiple users to
   use the Software package on multiple machines.

-  **Enterprise (Perpetual)**: Typically granted to an organization,
   this type of License allows unlimited use of the Software in the
   organization for a continuous period. Activations are done using one
   master key rather than multiple keys.

-  **Unlimited Machines**: In this type of License, an organization buys
   the right to use the Software for a specific period. When the period
   is over, the License is renewed. During the usage period, the License
   can be used by an unlimited number of machines.

-  **OEM**: This type of License is applicable for Software that comes
   pre-installed with hardware. The License limits the use of the
   Software on a specific Hardware.

-  **Single User**: This is an exclusive License for a defined user who
   uses the Software. The License carries the name of the user.

-  **Node Lock**: A Node Lock License is an encrypted key that is locked
   to a specific machine. Motadata automatically sets the Purchase
   Count for this type to one.

-  **Volume Users**: A Volume License denotes the product key used when
   installing software licensed in bulk, which allows a single product
   key to be used for multiple users.

-  **Unlimited Users**: This type of License allows unlimited use of the
   Software by users for a specific period.

-  **Free License**: This type of License allows the free use of the
   Software.
