Searching a License
*******************

In the Software Licenses page (Asset >> :ref:`Software Licenses <Adding a License>`), you can search for a license using a search box.
The search bar supports only three search options; you can access the search options by clicking on the search bar. A user can search
by:

- Name of the License.
- Name of the associated product.
- License type.
