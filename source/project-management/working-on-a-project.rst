Working on a Project
********************

When a :ref:`project is created <Create a New Project>`, it is only visible to the project creator, and the following operations
can be performed with the project. 

Assign Project
==============

The project creator can assign the project to himself or any other technician. He has the option to make assignment while creating a project, from the
:ref:`project list view <Project Management List View>` and :ref:`project details view <Project Details View>`.

Add Members to the Project
==========================

A project owner/creator can assign technicians to a project as members. A member can perform all the actions
related to project as permitted by :ref:`Technician Role <Technician Roles>`. 

Members are added from the :ref:`details view <Project Details View>` of a project.
