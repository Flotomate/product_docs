Create a Service Category
*************************

A Service Category is a general classification of the type of services provided under the IT Service Offering.

Service Category allows you to group Templates into meaningful categories; 
Currently, it is the only available classification available.

We are going to create a new category, called Human Resource, for our :ref:`On-Board <sc-use-case>` template.

Adding Service Catalog Categories 
=================================

-  We go to **Admin** (A Navigation tab) >> **Service Categories** (under Service Catalog).

- We click on **Add** to add a new category. The Add Category dialog box opens.

- In the new dialog box, we select the Request Category (Service Request) and give a Name (Human Resource).

  The Request Category refers to the same category used for :ref:`classifying Request <ad-category>`. The selection made here will be used when a 
  Request is created from a Service Item (the Request will inherit the Request Category) using a Template having the said Service Category.

- You can add sub-categories to a category, up to two levels. 

**Edit Categories**

All custom categories whether imported or added can be edited/deleted. In the Categories page, you will find the respective options.
