Creating a Request from a Service Item
**************************************

A Request created using a Service Item has the following characteristics:

- It has pre-filled information.

- It has dedicated Workflow and SLA.

- It has its own Approval Workflow.

- It has defined Task/Tasks, and Tasks are sometimes divided into stages.

Based on the set :ref:`sc-use-case`, we have done the following things:

- Created a :doc:`Service Category <create-service-category>`.

- Created a :doc:`Service Template <creating-a-template>`.

- Created a :doc:`Service Item <create-service-item>`.

In the previous section, we had created a Service Item called :doc:`Employee On-Boarding (Marketing)<create-service-item>`.
In this section, we will show you how it is used by Requestors in creating on-board Requests.

A person from the HR dept has initiated the on-boarding process of a new employee in the Marketing dept. 
Now he wants to create the credentials for the new employee. He goes to the Customer Portal to use a Service Item.

- He logs into the Customer Portal and clicks on **Service Catalog**.
