Creating a Request from a Service Item
**************************************

A Request created using a Service Item has the following characteristics:

- It has pre-filled information.

- It has dedicated Workflow and SLA.

- It has its own Approval Workflow.

- It has defined Task/Tasks, and Tasks are sometimes divided into stages.

In the previous section, we had created a Service Item called :doc:`Employee On-Boarding (Marketing)<create-service-item>`.
In this section, we will show you how it is used by Requestors in creating on-board Requests.

A person from the HR dept has initiated the on-boarding process of a new employee in the Marketing dept. 
Now he wants to create the credentials for the new employee. He goes to the Customer Portal to use a Service Item.

- He logs into the Customer Portal and goes to the **My Request** section.

- From the Quick Create button, he opens the Service Catalog. He clicks the Human Resource category and
  selects the **Employee On-Boarding (Marketing)** item.
