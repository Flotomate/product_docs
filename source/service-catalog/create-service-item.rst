Creating a Service Item
***********************

A Service Item allows you to actually use a Template. It generates a visual que through 
which a Requestor can interact with a Template and create Request.

Based on the set :ref:`sc-use-case`, we have done the following things:

- Created a :doc:`Service Category <create-service-category>`.

- Created a :doc:`Service Template <creating-a-template>`.

Now we are going to create a Service Item. 

**To Create a Service Item**

- We go to **Admin** (A Navigation tab) >> **Templates** (under Service Catalog).

- In the Templates page, select a category and click on **Create Service**.

  We can also find this option when editing a Template and on the **Admin** >> **Services** page.

-  The Create a New Service dialog box opens. Here you get the following fields:

   .. note:: When creating a Service Item from Admin >> Service page, there will be a field called Service Template where
             you have to select a Service Catalog Template. 
   
   a. Name of the Service

   b. **Group Access Level**: You can restrict access to Requestors belonging to a particular group on Custom Portal. But the
      Service Item will be visible to everyone on the Technician Portal.

   c. You can upload an image thumbnail.

   d. Subject and Description of a Request created using the Service Item. 

   We fill the fields and click on **Create**.

- Now we have a Service Item that can be used by the HR dept in their On-Boarding process. 

**Edit/Use of a Service Item by Admin**

An administrator can edit a Service Item from 
**Admin** (A Navigation Tab) >> **Services** (under Service Catalog) page.
