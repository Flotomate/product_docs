Users rely on the Service Catalog to avail services from the IT department. Flotomate provides an ITILÂ®-compliant service catalog 
solution that helps in streamlining service management and to increase opportunities for self-service. 

What is an IT service catalog?
==============================

A Service Catalog is a pre-defined list of services items. The scope of each service item (on offer) is defined using a template. 
A customer interacts with a Service Item, created from a template, to avail services from the IT department. Users (with admin right) can define custom
automation for each template.  

A best-practice IT Service Catalog:

- Is ITIL-compliant
- Improves customer satisfaction
- Improves reputation of IT service department
- Provides efficient engagement channel for standard services with or without authorizations
- Showcases availability of services for business user consumption
- Improves IT opportunities for service automation resulting in higher service delivery performance

A Service Catalog focuses on what is currently available rather than be an archive for service items.

Use Case
========

In the subsequent sections, we are going to create a Service Item for employee on-board (in Marketing) which is going to be used
by the HR department of Acme.Inc. In this hypothetical scenario, a person from the HR department will interact with a Service Item (created from
a Template called On-Board) to create credentials for new joiners in the Marketing department.

- Learn about the process involved in creating a Service Item from scratch (:doc:`service-catalog-workflow`). 

- We are first going to create a Service Catalog Category called Human Resource (:doc:`create-service-category`). 

- We then create a Template called On-Boarding in the above created Category (:doc:`creating-a-template`).

- Using the Template we create a service Item (:doc:`create-service-item`).
