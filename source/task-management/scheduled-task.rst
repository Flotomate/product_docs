Creating a Task Schedule
========================

Schedules created by a user are visible to him/her, and only he/she can manage the schedules (create, modify and delete).

.. note:: There's an exception to the above rule; the super admin can manage the schedules of other people along with his/her.

To create a new schedule a technician does the following:

- Technician goes to the Launcher >> **My Tasks**.

- Technician then clicks on **Scheduled Tasks** from the navigation menu.
