Create a New Tasks
******************

My Tasks module allows a technician to create and assign new tasks. Tasks created here are general tasks that aren't associated with
any other module. 

A technician can create a new task by:

- Going to the :ref:`My Tasks <Access My Tasks>` page.

- Clicking on the **Create Task** button in the top right corner. The create task dialog box opens where the technician can input
  following:

  .. _task-9:
  .. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/task_management/TASK-9.png
      :align: center
      :alt: figure 9

  a. Name of the task

  b. Select a technician who will be the assigned technician. 

  c. Set priority and task type. 

  d. Set start and end date of the task.

  e. Write description of the task. 

  f. Task creator can attach files with the task. 

- Clicking on **Create** when done.

General tasks don't have reference information, meaning they aren't relate to any module.
