Adding permission to an Article/FAQ
===================================

An author can add permission when creating a content and editing it. Learn how to :ref:`create an Article/FAQ <Authoring an Article/FAQ>` 
and :ref:`editing <Opening an Article/FAQ>`. 

When a content is in edit mode, the author can add a permission from the Permissions button in the top right corner. 

Types of Permissions
--------------------

1. **Read Permission**: In a private Article/FAQ the author can explicitly mention who can view the content. He/she 
   can select individual requesters and also requester groups. In a public content every requester has the view right.
