Introduction to Knowledge Management
************************************

Knowledge Management is an ITIL process that talks about capturing,
storing, sharing and managing IT Service related information. It aims to
make IT Service Operations effective and efficient. IT Service
Operations include activities like fulfilling Requests, resolving
Incidents, Solving Problems, and implementing Changes.

The primary outcome of Knowledge Management is the creation of a central
repository, which we refer to as Knowledge in Motadata. The purpose of
Knowledge is to capture and share information that would assist in
performing IT Service Operations.
