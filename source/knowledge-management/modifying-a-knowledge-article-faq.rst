Modifying a Knowledge Article/FAQ
*********************************

Anyone who has the right to update the Knowledge can edit the content of
a Knowledge Article/FAQ.

Opening an Article/FAQ
======================

From :doc:`Knowledge Homepage <trashing-an-article-faq>`:

-  You can search for an Article/FAQ using the :doc:`search
   features <search-&-browse-articles-faqs>`. Clicking on a title from the
   result opens the Article/FAQ.

-  You can also click on a title shown under **Most Read** and **FAQ**.

-  You can preview any Article/FAQ within a folder. While
   :ref:`previewing <browse-articles>`, click on **Read full article** to
   open the Article/FAQ.

Editing an Article/FAQ 
======================

1. Open an Article/FAQ.

    :align: center
    :alt: figure 45

2. Click on Edit (:numref:`kbf-45`) which puts the Article/FAQ in edit mode.
   You know you are in edit mode when you see **Save as Draft** in the
   top right corner of the page.

3. When you are done editing, save your Article/FAQ as a draft (for
   Articles) using **Save as Draft** or publish directly (for FAQs).

4. The moment you draft the Article, the status changes to Draft and
   the Publish button appears. Refer to :numref:`kbf-46`.

   The original article stays published and shows that it has unsaved
   changes. You can directly publish the Article if :doc:`Custom Publish
   Rule <kb-custom-publish-rule>` is not set. Else, all your drafts
   have to go through an :ref:`Approval <kb-approval>` process
   before being published.

        :alt: figure 47

   .. note:: You canâ€™t put an FAQ in the draft. You have to publish any
              changes directly.

You can also put an Article/FAQ in edit mode from its preview in the
:ref:`Browse Article <browse-articles>` section.
