Categorizing Articles/FAQs
**************************

You have to organize your Articles/FAQs using folders. You can create n
number of folders and manage them the way you want.

Folders give your Knowledge a structure which makes it usable. While
structuring your folders, it is essential to consider the behavior of
your audience. By behavior, we mean how your audience search for
information; do they surf or do they use a search bar.

It is a general practice to put quick reference materials on the top and
then follow a simple, meaningful structure. Avoid over categorization to
prevent confusion among your audience.

be visible in the :ref:`folder <Adding a Folder>` which was selected while creating the content.
