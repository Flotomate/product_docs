Search & Browse Articles/FAQs
*****************************

There are three broad ways to search Articles/FAQs in the product:

-  Keyword-based search

-  Advanced Search

-  Browsing Articles

Keyword Based Search
====================

In the Knowledge Homepage, you can search for Articles/FAQs using
keywords in the search bar. When you enter a keyword in the search bar,
the product searches all Articles/FAQs with the keyword in their
content, title, Tags, Knowledge ID and attached/uploaded files.

To perform a search:

-  Go to the :doc:`Knowledge Homepage <knowledge-homepage>`.

-  In the search bar, type in your keyword/keywords. All match results
   are shown as a drop-down.

-  Clicking on **View all Result** opens another page (Search Results)
   where all matched results are separately shown under Article and FAQ.

        :alt: figure 36

   In the Search Result page, you can initiate new searches using the
   search bar with new keywords.

Advanced Search
===============

You can narrow down your search for an Article/FAQ using predefined
search options. The search options are available in a separate dialog
box. Advance search exists in the product to help you sort your search
results and initiate multi-condition searches. It works in conjunction
with keyword-based search.

The dialog box can be accessed from :doc:`Knowledge
Homepage <knowledge-homepage>` and Search Result page.

-  Log in to the Technician Portal.

-  Go to the :doc:`Knowledge Homepage <knowledge-homepage>`.

-  In the Homepage, click on **Advanced Search** situated far right of
   the search bar. The Advanced Search dialog box opens.

    .. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/knowledge-management/KB-37.png
        :align: center
        :alt: figure 37

    .. _kbf-38:
    .. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/knowledge-management/KB-38.png
        :align: center
        :alt: figure 38

  The dialog box only has a search bar. Here you can add conditions using
  three predefined options.

  You can access the search options by clicking on the search bar. Using
  the options, you can search all Articles/FAQs by:

  a. Subject contains (refers to the tile section of an Article/FAQ)

  b. Tags equals

  c. Author equals

  You can create conditions using more than one search option. Between
  two different conditions of the same option type OR logic is
  followed, and between different option types AND logic is followed.
  An example of conflicting conditions is **Tags equals** important vs.
  **Tags equals** critical; the result shows all Articles/FAQs with
  important and critical tags.

  .. note:: The string that you enter as part of a condition is case
            sensitive.

  Click on **Done** when you are finished setting your conditions.
  Whatever conditions you have set appear above the Homepage search
  bar. You can remove the conditions.

    .. _kbf-39:
    .. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/knowledge-management/KB-39.png
        :align: center
        :alt: figure 39

  In :numref:`kbf-39`, the condition is set to **Tags equal Setup**, and it works
  in conjunction with the keyword workflow. The system searches the entire
  Knowledge with the condition and keyword.

Browse Articles
===============

The Knowledge contents are compartmentalized into folders. Users are
responsible for creating the folders and ordering them. When a user
creates a new Article or FAQ, he/she has to specify a folder where the
content is stored.

You can view and browse all the folders in Knowledge. You can access the
contents of each folder. When you access the contents, you also get
access to Analytics.

-  Go to :doc:`Knowledge Homepage <knowledge-homepage>`.

-  In the Homepage, click on **Browse Articles**. A pane opens on top of
   the Homepage.

To understand this pane, you need to understand two views:

-  **Overall View**: This aspect comprises of two main sections:

        :align: center
        :alt: figure 41

    a. Section-A is where you can view and access all folders, the
      :doc:`Trash <trashing-an-article-faq>`, search folders, and create new
      folders option. Learn more about :doc:`creating
      folders <modifying-a-knowledge-article-faq>`.

    b. Section-B shows you the following information:

     ii. Top five helpful Articles/FAQs based on the feedback from the
         readers.

     iii. Most searched keywords on all portals combined.

-  **Folder View**: You get this view when you open a folder (the view
   is same for Trash). The view comprises of two main sections:

    .. _kbf-42:
    .. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/knowledge-management/KB-42.png
        :align: center
        :alt: figure 42

    a. Section-A shows the contents of the folder.

    b. Section-B is the preview section of an Article/FAQ. In a preview,
       first few paragraphs are shown along with its Analytics.

        .. _kbf-43:
        .. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/knowledge-management/KB-43.png
            :align: center
            :alt: figure 43

      You can manage an Article/FAQ from its preview (Edit,
      :doc:`Share <sharing-an-article-faq>`, :doc:`Print <print-an-article-faq>` and
      :doc:`Delete <trashing-an-article-faq>`). The Content Analytics show you the
      following things:

      i.  Estimated time required to read the entire Article/FAQ (in
          minutes).

      ii. Total Pageviews which means the number of times people have opened
          the Article/FAQ.

      iii. The number of down-votes and up-votes.

      Under the name of the writer, you can view the status of the
      Article/FAQ, whether itâ€™s published or in the draft. You also get
      a warning of unpublished changes here.
