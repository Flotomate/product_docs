Authoring an Article/FAQ
************************

Flotomate provides the Knowledge Editor to create and publish
Articles/FAQs. The editor has built-in text formatting features and the
capability to add visual media like pictures and videos. You also get
the option to save your Article (FAQ doesn’t support draft) as a draft
and publish it later.

Knowledge can have two types of entries:

-  **Article**: It is a lengthy piece of writing that talks about in
   details about a process, concept, idea or a mix of everything.

-  **FAQ**: It is an answer to a frequently asked question. The
   Knowledge Homepage has a separate section to show FAQs in the system.

Both of the types use the same Knowledge Editor, and both have access to
the same formatting options.

To write an Article/FAQ:

1. Log in to your Dashboard and click on **KNOWLEDGE** (A Navigation
   Tab).

2. The Knowledge Homepage opens. Click on **Create** situated in the top
   right corner of the page.

3. Select whether you want to write an Article or an FAQ. The Knowledge
   Editor opens.

        :align: center
        :alt: figure 4.2


   .. note:: Creating Knowledge content requires :ref:`Create Knowledge<Technician Roles>` right.

   .. note:: Please refer to :numref:`kbf-4.2`.

4. In section-A (:numref:`kbf-4.2`), you add a title to the Article (Question in
   case of an FAQ). A suitable title should convey the purpose of the
   Article using searchable keywords.

5. In section-B (:numref:`kbf-4.2`), you get to define the following things:

    a. **Folder Name**: This is a required field. An Article/FAQ has to
       reside in a folder, and users create all the folders in Knowledge.
       This is the primary way to categorize Articles/FAQs.

       Clicking on **Select Folder** opens a dialog box. In the dialog
       box, you can search folders and even create new ones. Select a
       Folder and click on **Done**.

        .. _kbf-5:
        .. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/knowledge-management/KB-5.png
            :align: center
            :alt: figure 5


    b. **Visibility**: This is a required field in the sense that it can’t
       be left empty. You get two visibility options; you have to select
       one:

        .. _kbf-6:
        .. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/knowledge-management/KB-6.png
            :align: center
            :alt: figure 6

        i. **Public**: The Article/FAQ is visible to everyone on both the
           Customer and Technician Portal. On the Customer Portal, anyone can
           view the Article/FAQ without logged in. Learn more about :ref:`public view permission`.

        ii. **Private**: The Article/FAQ will be visible to the owner and the super-admin by default. The owner can set a 
            different read permission if he/she wants. Learn more about :ref:`private view permission`. 

    c. **Tags**: Here you add tags to the Article/FAQ. Using tags, you can
       add keywords to make it more searchable.

6. Section-C & D make the body of the Article/FAQ where you capture the
   knowledge using textual and visual means.

   The editing area comes with two toolbars (section-C). Some of the
   important operations you can perform using the toolbars are:

    .. _kbf-7:
    .. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/knowledge-management/KB-7.png
        :align: center

    a. Toggle to Fullscreen.

    b. Basic text formatting.

    c. Inserting links, images, videos, files, emoji, special characters,
       and tables.

    d. Inserting :doc:`Sections <collaboration-in-knowledge>`.

    e. Print the body area.

    f. Undo & Redo.

   Section-D is the area where you write the body. Write your body using
   formatting options in section-C.

7. Section-E is the Quick Insert button which is part of the body area.
   The Quick Insert button appears when the cursor is left-aligned. The
   button allows you to insert the following things at the cursor
   location:

    a. Image

    b. Video

    c. Table (2x2)

    d. Bulleted List

    e. Numbered List

    f. Horizontal Line

    g. :doc:`Sections <collaboration-in-knowledge>`

   Use the Quick insert button to speed up your formatting process of
   the body.

8. The first step towards publishing an Article is to save it as a draft
   (section-F). A drafted Article is visible to technicians (on technician portal) with:

   - Write permission when the Article is private. Public drafted articles are visible to all technician cum requesters.

   .. note:: A super admin can see all drafted articles doesn’t matter whether they are private or public.

   - Knowledge view rights (:ref:`Learn More <Technician Roles>`).

   The moment you draft your Article, a Publish button appears. If you
   don’t want to publish it immediately, then you can open the drafted
   Article anytime later and publish it, as the Publish button stays as
   long as the Article is in the draft. Learn more about :doc:`Publishing
   Drafted Article <publishing-a-drafted-article>`.

   .. note:: Only the owner can publish a drafted article.

   Section-F also houses the back button that takes you to the previous
   page. Other than the back button, you have the :ref:`Permissions <Knowledge Permissions>` option
   to set the permissions for the selected  visibility.

   Once you are done with your Article/FAQ, save it as a draft and
   :doc:`publish <publishing-a-drafted-article>` it later or immediately.
