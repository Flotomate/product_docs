Approval
========

In case there is a :ref:`custom rule <Custom Publish Rule>`, then you have
to make every drafted Article go through an Approval process before
publishing it. In an Approval process, you seek approval from an
approver/approvers.

Initiating Approval Process:
----------------------------

.. note:: only a creator of an Article can initiate an Approval for the same.

-  Open a drafted Article.

-  Click on **More** and then **Approval**.

.. _kbf-21:
.. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/knowledge-management/KB-21.png
    :align: center
    :alt: figure 21

-  Approval details dialog box opens. Clicking on **Ask for Approval** initiates the Approval process

Different States in an Approval Process
---------------------------------------

-  Approval Pending:

-  Approval Rejected:

-  Approval Pre-Approved:

-  Approval Approved:

Approval Process:
-----------------

.. note:: An assigned Technician can initiate an Approval process for n number of times. At the start of each process, the 
          Article will start from the Pending status. 

-  An Approval can be initiated manually or automatically by an Approval Workflow. When the :ref:`manual approval option <Allow Manual Approval>` 
   is turned on, you get the following dialog box when you click on **Ask for Approval**.

    .. _kbf-21.1:
    .. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/knowledge-management/KB-21.1.png
        :align: center
        :alt: figure 21.1  

   When you create a manual approval, the system also checks for Approval workflows. Incase a workflow is triggered,
   both the manual approval and an automatic Approval are created. You can skip manual approval altogether using the 
   **Skip** button. 

-  When an Approval process is initiated, first the system checks for
   available Approval Workflows. If there are no workflows and no manual approval, then the
   drafted Article is Pre-Approved, and you can proceed with publishing.
   If there is a workflow or a manual approval, then based on its set conditions
   approver/approvers are auto-assigned/assigned for approval.

-  You can view all the approvers and their comments in the Approval
   details dialog box.

        :alt: figure 22

   The Approval status changes to Pending, and it stays there as long as
   the approver/approvers donâ€™t express a decision.

-  An approver can see his Approvals in the My Approvals section of his
   account.

    a. Open the Article.

    b. Start a comment thread which is visible to anyone having access to
       the comment section.

    c. Reject or Approve the Approval

-  The outcome of an Approval process is decided in two ways:

   a. **Unanimous**: All of the Approvers have to approve else the
      Approval is rejected.

   b. **Majority**: If the majority of Approvers agree then Approval is
      successful.

      In case there are multiple Approvals, the decision to go with
      unanimous or majority can be set from **Admin** (A Navigation Tab)
      >> **Approval Workflow** (Automation) >> **Approval Settings**,
      but the rights to do it lies with the Super Admin.

-  On success, the Approval moves to the Approved stage where the author
   can publish the draft. On failure, the Approval moves to the Reject
   stage where the author has to re-initiate the Approval process. The
   author re-initiates an Approval process using the Re-Approve option or by starting a fresh approval using the **Ask for Approval** option.

-  Any Technician with the **Can Ignore Approval** right can ignore
   approvers and push the Approval towards the Approved stage; where he
   can publish the draft. The ignored approvers can see their Approval
   status as Ignored in Approval details dialog box of the Article.
