Introduction to Reports
=======================

The Motadata generates a lot of data which you can convert into
meaningful information using Reports. The reporting feature allows you
to generate an organized representation of system data. The result is
printable reports that you can share with others.

You get to choose the filter parameters and data columns and using those
you can generate n numbers of permutations, each resulting in a
different report. You can automate the report generation process using a
feature called scheduling; once set, you get periodic emails with a
report based on your set conditions.

You can generate reports across the following modules:

-  Request

-  Problem

-  Change

-  Asset

-  Remote Deployment - Patches

-  Remote Deployment - Agent

-  Software License

-  Project

-  Contract

-  Purchase

**Benefits of Report**

Some of the benefits of having the reporting feature are as follows:

1. There is a better understanding of opportunities for optimization.
   For example, you can generate a report highlighting the average time
   taken for each technician to close a Request over a period. Armed
   with this information, you can map the efficiency of your
   technicians.

2. Generate reports to influence the short and long-term management
   strategies and policies.

3. Cost reduction and streamline of processes. For example, using
   Reports, you can understand the utilization of your IT Assets; thus
   you can plan your future IT purchases or justify an existing
   purchase.

4. Helps in benchmarking and setting goals. For example, you can monitor
   the overall performance of your technicians and know whether they are
   meeting the set benchmark. Similarly, you can track different KPIs in
   other modules using different parameters.

Types of Reports
----------------

There are four types of Reports that you can generate:

-  **Tabular Report**: This type of Reports list items in columns
   grouped by either time or product properties. For example, you can
   create a Tabular Report that lists Assets grouped by Technicians who
   manage them. Learn how to create a :ref:`Tabular Report <create-tabular-report>` .

-  **Matrix Report**: This type of Reports generate cumulative counts of
   items in a grid grouped by either time or a product property. For
   example, you can generate a report that lists the average resolution
   time of each Technician. Here average resolution time accounts for
   all the Reports that a Technician has resolved. Learn how to create a 
   :ref:`Matrix Report <create-matrix-report>`.

-  **Summary Report**: This type of Reports can summarize properties,
   details, milestones, and components of items in Asset, Projects,
   Patches, and Software License. Learn how to create a :ref:`Summary
   Report <create-summary-report>`.

-  **Multi-Module Report**: You can combine two or more Reports into a
   single Report. This is called a Multi-Module Report. Learn how to
   create a :ref:`Multi-Module Report <create-multi-module>`.
