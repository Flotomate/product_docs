**Generating a Preview**

Section-A is where you select a timeframe for the preview. Enter a Start
Date and End Date. Based on this range, data is fetched considering
either Create Time, Update Time or Closed Time. Click **Get Preview** to
generate a preview.

Section-B shows you the condition/conditions based on which data is
filtered.

Section-C is where you get to see a preview of the Report.

**Other options**

Section-D houses four options:

-  Delete the Report.

-  :ref:`Edit the Report <editing-report>`.

-  :doc:`Export/Share feature. <share-a-report>`

**Downloading Report**

You can download the Report either in PDF or Excel by clicking on
**Download Now**. If the Report is too long, then you cannot download
it. You have to use the :doc:`export feature <share-a-report>` and receive
the Report as an email attachment.
