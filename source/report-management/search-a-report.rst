Motadata ITSM tool gives you three features to search for a Report in the Report List

Selecting a Folder
==================

In the :ref:`Report List View`, the Reports are grouped into folders. It's compulsory to put a Report in a folder. You can search for
a Report within a folder and even apply filters.

Searching a Report within a Folder
----------------------------------

Once you select a folder, the product allows you to search for a Report using a keyword/keywords.
The search bar is at the top of the :ref:`Report List View`.

When you type in a keyword in the search bar, the product searches all
the Reports with the keyword in their Name and Description. Reports that
have the keyword are shown in the list area. In case there are multiple
keywords, all keywords need to be present in a Report in order to have a
match.
