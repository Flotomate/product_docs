Search a Report
===============

Flotomate gives you two ways to search for a Report in the Report List
View:

**Use Search Bar**

The product allows you to search for a Report using a keyword/keywords.
The search bar is at the top of the `Report List
View <#report-list-view>`__.

When you type in a keyword in the search bar, the product searches all
the Reports with the keyword in their Name and Description. Reports that
have the keyword are shown in the list area. In case there are multiple
keywords, all keywords need to be present in a Report in order to have a
match.

**Use Filters**

There are two types of filters in the Report List View: one that filters
Reports based on a selected module, and the other that filters Reports
based on whether a Report is pre-defined or custom.

Apart from filtering Reports module wise, you can have an overview of
the distribution of Reports across all the modules.

You can quickly toggle between Pre-Defined Reports and Custom Reports:

-  **Pre-Defined Report**: Flotomate comes preloaded with 23 predefined
   Reports. These are standard Reports commonly used in the product.

-  **Custom Report**: These are Reports that you create using the `New
   Custom Report <#create-&-edit>`__ page.
