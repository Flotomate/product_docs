Creating Multi-Module Report
****************************

You can create a Report that summarizes the output of multiple Reports.
The feature that allows you to do this is called multi-module.

-  We open the :ref:`Create a Custom Report <new-custom-report>` dialog box.

-  We are going to create a Report called Multi-Module Report that has
   the output of two Reports (Computer Asset List and Average Resolution
   Time).

-  Following is our selections/inputs for the sections in **Create a Custom Report** dialog box and **New Custom Report** page:
