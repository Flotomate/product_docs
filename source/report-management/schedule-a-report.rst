Schedule a Report
=================

You can periodically receive a generated Report via email using the
Schedule option. You decide the time interval when to receive, and in
what format you want to receive the Report.

In Public Reports, Schedules are user specific meaning that a user can
manage and view Schedules that he creates.

In Private Reports, only the creator of a Report can make and view a
Schedule.
