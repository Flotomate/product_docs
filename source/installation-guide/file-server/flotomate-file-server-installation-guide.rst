File Server Installation Guide

.. important:: Use of Shared Drive for Remote Deployment has been deprecated. Instead we now use a File Server.

A file server is a computer responsible for central storage of data. A file server works in conjunction with our main server, 
and it's the backbone for Remote Deployment. A file server is a must in the following usage scenarios:

- Deployment of Patches.
- Deployment of Packages.
- Self-upgrade of Flotomate Agent application.

Shared drive configuration in our product has been deprecated, and the architecture allows 
delivery of Patch/Packages to Agent/Relay via File Server only.

How File Server Works
=====================

Installing Flotomate File Server
================================

Prerequisite
------------

- Separate Linux server for File Server installation.
- You need ubuntu-16.04.1 Server OS to run. 

  Minimum Hardware Requirement:

  a. 64bit architecture.

  b. 100 GB hard-disk space.

  c. 2 GB RAM

  Follow the link to download the OS:

  https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-customer-releases/share/ubuntu_server_os.iso

Installation Steps
------------------

In order to initiate a file server you need to configure in three places (Main Server , Relay server (if required), and File Server).

Download Relay Server: `Download Link <https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-customer-releases/latest/relay+server/linux/relay_server_CI>`_

.. note:: We provide a single build for Relay and File Server. You have to install them separately: one as file server and other, 
          relay server.

In File Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Copy release build installer (relay_server_CI) to target machine.

- Make Sure you have execute permission to build file. If it does not
  have execute permission then you can change it by following command,

  **sudo chmod 777 relay_server_CI**

- Run Installer by following command

  **sudo ./relay_server_CI**

        :alt: figure 1

- Type in your system pass and hit enter to start the installation process.

- Once you see the below screen, that means you have successfully installed the relay server.

- Acquire root access: **sudo -i**.

- Change directory: **cd/opt/flotomate/relay-server/config**

- Open yaml file using: **nano services-conf.yaml**

- change under main-server : **URL={your main server url}**

- Now restart services: **systemctl restart ft-relay-server.service** (Do not forgot this)

In Relay Server (If in use)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install Relay Server:

- Copy release build installer (relay_server_CI) to target machine.

- Make Sure you have execute permission to build file. If it does not
  have execute permission then you can change it by following command,

  **sudo chmod 777 relay_server_CI**

- Run Installer by following command

  **sudo ./relay_server_CI**

        :align: center
        :alt: figure 1

- Type in your system pass and hit enter to start the installation process.

- Once you see the below screen, that means you have successfully installed the relay server.

Type the following commands in the terminal of the relay server (a separate server altogether) to change **Service-conf.yaml** file.

- Get root access: **sudo -i**

- Change directory: **cd /opt/flotomate/relay-server/config**

- Open: **nano services-conf.yaml**

- Change under main-server : **URL={your main server url}**

- Restart services: **systemctl restart ft-relay-server.service** (Do not forgot this).

In Main Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Do following step to change  Service-conf.yaml file in the Main Server.

.. note:: Learn :ref:`how to install server <Flotomate Service Desk â€“ Server Installation via Build>`.

- Get root access: **sudo -i**

- Change directory: **cd /opt/flotomate/main-server/config**

- Open: **nano application-hosted.properties**

- Change the following field: **com.flotomate.fileServer.url=http://{file Server Ip}:7070/api** (change port if you have changed port of file server)
