Predefined Dashlets
*******************

Currently, Motadata gives 23 Predefined Dashlets out of the box. Each of them have different parameters set. 
These Dashlets support the following operations:

- Predefined Dashlets are shared with all users having the :ref:`Dashboard rights`. They can be added to all kinds of Dashboards by
  their respective owners.
  
- The super user is the default owner of all Predefined Dashlets.

- Only the super user can modify (even add Dashlets) a Predefined Dashlet but cannot delete it.

- The options to ignore time and location filters are disabled for Predefined Dashlets.
