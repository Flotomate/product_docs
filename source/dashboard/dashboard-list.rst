Whenever a user logs into the Technician Portal he/she is greeted by the Default Dashboard. In the system, there are two types of Dashboards:
Predefined Dashboard and Custom Dashboard; and any one of them can be made the Default Dashboard. 

Predefined Dashboards are available to all users. Custom Dashboards are profile specific, meaning a user sees his own (created) Dashboards plus
Dashboards shared with him/her by others.
