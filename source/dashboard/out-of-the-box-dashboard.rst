Out of the Box Dashboards
*************************

Flotomate ITSM tool provides four predefined Dashboards out of the box. Each of them have a theme that showcases specific Dashlets.
The Dashboards are as follows:

.. note:: A user can view all the Dashboards from the :ref:`Dashboard List`. 

1. **Helpdesk Dashboard**: This Dashboard shows key metrics from the :ref:`Request Management <what-is-request>` module. The idea
   behind the Dashboard is to give a snapshot of the efficiency with which Technicians are solving Request tickets. Here you get the
   following Dashlets and filters:

   a. Data range (filter) of last 7 days and all locations.

   b. Count of Open and Closed filter (KPI).

   c. Count of overdue and unassigned tickets (KPI).

   d. Graphical representation (widget) of ticket count by categories (for the given time range).

   e. Graphical representation (widget) of ticket count by Priority (for the given time range).

   f. Graphical representation (widget) of ticket count by Technician's Request count by priority (for the given time range).

   g. Graphical representation (widget) of ticket count by Technician's SLA violation by day (for the given time range).

   .. note:: This is the default Dashboard when you open Dashboard for the first time.
