Batch Deployment of Packages
****************************

When deploying Packages over a large number of computers, it may cause unwanted consumption of network bandwidth. We have created Batch Deployment
to overcome this problem. 

Batch Deployment allows you to deploy Packages in a specific number of PCs at a time. Batch Deployment is by default turned off.
