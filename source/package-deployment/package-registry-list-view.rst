Packages/Registry List View
===========================

The UI is divided across packages/registries and Computers. One aspect
lets you view packages & registry templates and perform related
operations, and the Computer aspect lets you view all Computers and
perform related operations.

We have the Package/Registry List View that gives a point & click
interface to manage all package/registry from a single place. The view
is divided across Windows and Linux platform.
