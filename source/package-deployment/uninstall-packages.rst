Uninstall Package using a Deployment Request
********************************************

The default setup of Package Management is to install Packages on to a select set of Computers. But you can create a Deployment Request
that uninstalls Packages. This feature is available for Packages that have been added to the system. 

The ability to install and uninstall Packages gives a complete experience to users in managing their IT Infrastructure.

**To Create an Uninstall Deployment Request:**

- Go to the :ref:`Deployment Request Page <Adding a Package Deployment Request>` 

- On the page, click on **Uninstall Packages** from the Action Menu.
