Configuring Endpoint Scope
**************************

Depending on the License agreement you have with us, the number of
Computers you can manage for Software/Registry update Deployment is limited. All discovered
Computers (with our Agent application) stay out of the scope of the main
server for Desktop Automation by default; you have to bring them within the scope before you
can use Remote Deployment.

The Endpoint Scope lets you view all available Computers (both in and out of Endpoint scope) and add them to the Scope. You can set certain conditions that
allow the product to add any new Computer automatically. You can also
add Computers manually.

There is a counter that shows how many Computers you can add to the scope. In no situation, you can exceed the
total number of Computers you are allowed to add to the Scope. The Endpoint Scope can have multiple sub-scopes, each one can 
accommodate a different Remote Office.

.. note:: Only Computers configured with our Agent application is visible
          on the Endpoint Scope page.
