Introduction to Deployment

What is Deployment?
===================

Deployment (in Flotomate) refers to the capability of installing, uninstalling and
upgrading computer programs, and configuring Windows Registry in a
large set of computers remotely. It is vital for managing the life-cycle
of a Computer on a large scale, and Flotomate provides a comprehensive
tool that handles all aspects of Package/Registry Deployment intuitively
and efficiently.

So using the Deployment feature, users can:

- Remotely install or uninstall Software across a large set of computers.

- Remotely manage Windows Registry across a large set of computers. For example; a user can disable Chrome update remotely 
  across all computers in the Endpoint Scope using a Registry Template.


What is a Software Package?
===========================

A Software package may refer to:

-  **Package** (package management system), in which individual files or
   resources are packed together as a software collection that provides
   specific functionality as part of a larger system.

-  **Software suite**, which provides an organized collection of
   multiple packages, or a package consisting of multiple separate
   pieces.


What is a Registry Template?
============================

In a Windows machine, the Registry is a hierarchical database of lower level settings. The purpose of it is to serve as an archive that
collects and stores configuration settings of Windows components, Hardware and Software. These configuration setting entires are retrieved
by their respective Windows components, Hardware and Software at startup.
 
The registry contains two basic elements: keys and values. A Registry Template created as part of Deployment has Keys and Values, when
deployed can manipulate the behavior of Windows components, Hardware and Software of a computer.

Benefits of Remote Deployment
=============================

Some of the benefits of having remote Deployment are as follows:

-  Package Deployment updates all administered IT Assets with the latest
   Software from the Vendor; this enhances security and helps in
   thwarting external and internal cyber-attacks.

-  Helps in conserving bandwidth when a program needs to be installed in
   a large number of administered IT Assets. Software Deployment in our
   product can happen from a Shared Drive which means an Admin has to
   install a program once on the Shared Drive and the Computers fetch
   it.

-  Often new Packages come with performance improvements and new
   features. Such enhancements increase the productivity of people using
   the administered Assets.

-  Having the latest Packages for all IT Assets (workstations and
   servers) prevents unplanned breakdowns due to a Software bug.

-  Using a Registry Deployment, users can fine-tune the behavior of the OS across a large set of computers.
