Uninstalling Patches Using a Deployment Request
***********************************************

The default setup of Patch Management is to install Patches on to a select set of Computers. But you can create a Deployment Request
that uninstalls Patches. This feature is available for Patches that have been categorized as installed. 

The ability to install and uninstall Patches gives a complete experience to users in managing their IT Infrastructure.

**To Create an Uninstall Deployment Request:**

- Go to the :ref:`patch-list-view`.

- Select **Installed** from one of the Quick Filters.
