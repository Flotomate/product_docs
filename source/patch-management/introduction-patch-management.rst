What is a Patch?
----------------

A patch is a piece of software designed to update a Computer program
or its supporting data, to fix or improve it. This includes fixing
security vulnerabilities and other bugs, with such patches usually
called bug-fixes or bug fixes, and improving the usability or
performance.

What is Patch Management?
-------------------------

Patch Management comes within the domain of Endpoint System Management.
It is the process of the acquiring, testing and deploying Patches across
administered IT Assets (generally workstations and servers) in a
systematic way. It also includes the administrative decision of deciding
which Patches are appropriate for deployment and documenting procedures
like required configurations.

Patch Management is vital for managing the life-cycle of an Asset, and
Flotomate provides a comprehensive tool that handles all aspects of
Patch Management intuitively and efficiently.

Benefits of Patch Management
----------------------------

Some of the benefits of having Patch Management are as follows:

-  Patch Management ensures that all administered IT Assets are updated
   with the latest Patch from the Software Vendor; this enhances
   security and helps in thwarting external and internal cyber-attacks.

-  Often Patches come with performance improvements and new features.
   Such enhancements increase the productivity of people using the
   administered Assets.

-  Having the latest Patch for all IT Assets (workstations and servers)
   prevents unplanned breakdowns due to a Software bug.

-  Laws and regulations are imposing security best practices and having
   Assets all patched up is the best way to comply with such rules.
