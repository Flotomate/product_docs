- You will get four options:

  a. **Without Target**: A duplicate copy of the deployment request will open without all the target machines.

  b. **With All Targets**: A duplicate copy of the deployment request will open with all the target machines.

  c. **With Yet to Apply Targets**: A duplicate copy of the deployment request will open with target machines yet to receive the deployment request.

  d. **With Failed Targets**: A duplicate copy of the deployment request will open with target machines that have failed to deploy as of now.

 Select an option that opens a duplicate deployment request. You can perform edits. 

- When done you can save the request as draft or publish it directly if allowed.
