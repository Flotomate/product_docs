Archive & Delete a Contract
***************************

There are two ways to remove a Contract from the system:

- **Delete**: Permanently removes a Contract from the system.

- **Archive**: Removes a Contract but can be retrieved later. 

You can remove a Contract in any status. You can remove a Parent Contract; Child Contracts remain unaffected and they are no longer a 
child.

**To Archive a Contract:**

- Go to the :doc:`contract-list-view`. 

- Click on **Archive** from the Action Menu of the Contract that you want to remove.
