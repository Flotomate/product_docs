Cancelling a Contract
*********************

Pre-mature termination of a Contract is a valid use case for many of our users. We have the Cancel option to terminate a Contract
pre-maturely (before expire). Only an assigned Technician of a Contract can initiate a cancellation.

To Cancel a Contract:

- Go to the :ref:`contract Details View` of the Contract that you want to cancel.

- Click on **Cancel** from the Action Menu.
