What is a Contract?
===================

A voluntary, deliberate, and legally binding agreement between two or more competent parties. 
Contracts are usually written but may be spoken or implied, and generally have to do with employment, sale or lease, or tenancy.

A contractual relationship is evidenced by (1) an offer, (2) acceptance of the offer, and a (3) valid (legal and valuable) consideration. 
Each party to a contract acquires rights and duties relative to the rights and duties of the other parties. 
However, while all parties may expect a fair benefit from the contract (otherwise courts may set it aside as inequitable) it does not follow that each party will benefit to an equal extent.

============================

Contract Management is the practice of managing the life-cycle of contracts. Contract creation, execution and analysis come

**Fundamentals of Contract Management**

A contract governs the commercial relationship between two organizations through terms and conditions. Contracts have a large impact on the
revenue and expenses of an organization. When a contract is made poorly, one organization might lose thousands of dollars for not being able to identify a simple technicality.
Effective Contract Management creates powerful business relationships and paves the road to greater profitability, but only when managed correctly.
