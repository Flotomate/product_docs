Custom Contract Field
*********************

Users can add Custom Contract Fields in the Contract module. Some of the use cases of having custom fields are:

- Custom fields can be used for capturing additional information about a Contract.

- Custom fields appear in the :ref:`Reporting module<Selecting Columns>`, where you can generate reports using custom fields.

- Custom fields are supported in CSV import of Contracts (as one of the header property values). Custom fields can be used to capture additional information during Contract
  :doc:`CSV import <uploading-contracts-csv>`.

**To add a Custom Field:**

- Go to **Admin** (A Navigation Tab) >> **Contract Custom Fields** (Contract Management).
