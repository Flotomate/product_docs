Assigning a Contract
********************

Assigning a Contract to a Technician makes that person responsible for
the Contract. He/she becomes the point of contact for all matters related
to the Contract.

An assigned Technician gets the following notifications:

- Email notification when the Contract is cancelled.

- Email notification when the Contract is Renewed.

- Email notification when the Contract is about to expire, 15 days prior.

- Email notification when the Contract is expired.

A Technician, with the necessary rights, can assign a Contract to another
Technician or claim it for himself/herself.

.. note:: You have to have viewing and managing rights to assign Contracts (Refer: :ref:`technician roles`).
