What is a Request?
==================

A Request is written documentation of an event, which could be an
outcome of an Incident or Service Request. The Service Desk is alerted
by a Request, and it is processed according to the workflow designed by
the organization.

All Requests are broadly categorized into two groups: Incidents and
Service Requests:

1. **Incident**: It is an unplanned disruption in IT-enabled
   organizational processes. For example, break down of a network
   router, server failure, etc.

2. **Service Requests**: It is a user request for information or advice,
   or for a standard change (a pre-approved change that is low risk,
   relatively common and follows a procedure) or for access to an IT
   service. A great example of a standard request is a password reset.
   Requests are usually handled by the Service Desk and do not require
   an RFC (Request for Change) to be submitted.

What is Request Management?

service delivery by standardizing Request handling processes,
