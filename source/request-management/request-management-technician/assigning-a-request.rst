Assigning a Request
*******************

Assigning a Request ticket to a Technician makes that person responsible for
the ticket. He/she becomes the point of contact for all matters related
to the Request ticket. An assigned Technician has the privilege to initiate an
Approval process when required.

A Technician, with the necessary Request rights, can assign a Request ticket to
other Technicians or claim it for himself/herself.

Learn more about: :ref:`Technician Roles`.

Assigning from List View
========================

1. Go to **Request** >> :doc:`Request List View <request-list-view>`.

2. Hover your mouse over the Request that you want to claim or assign.
   The **Claim** and **Assign** buttons appear. Perform the operation
   that you want.

   Selecting **Claim** assigns the Request ticket to the logged in technician, and you can view the assigned technician's
   name against the ticket's Subject line.

   You can assign the Request ticket to other Technicians. Selecting **Assign**
   pops up a list where you can see the names of other Technicians along
   with coloured rings showing the workload of each Technician. Red
   represents maximum load and green, minimum load.

Alternatively, you use Claim and Assign as a bulk operation. You can
Claim or Assign multiple Requests at once.
