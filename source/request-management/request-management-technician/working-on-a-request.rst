Viewing Other Requests Created by the Requestor
===============================================

The product has the provision to view all other Requests created by the Requestor from the Details View
of a Request.

- Go to the :ref:`Details View <request-details-view>` of a Request
- Hover your mouse over the Requestor info section of the page.
- A pop-up menu opens where you can access other Requests.

.. _rmf-18.1:

Classify Requests
=================

Flotomate provides many avenues to classify a Request. Go to the
:ref:`Details View <request-details-view>` of a Request, and there you get
the following ways:

.. _rmf-19:
.. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/request-management/RM-19.png
    :align: center
    :alt: figure 19

-  **Status**: Every Request has a life-cycle in the system. Setting the
   Status tag shows the stage at which the Request is in its life-cycle.
   There are seven Predefined statuses in the system: Open, In-Progress,
   Pending on Requester, Pending in Approval, Pending on Technician,
   Resolved and Closed. Other than In Progress, you cannot modify any of
   the predefined statuses.

   The status **Pending in Approval** is set automatically by the system
   whenever a Request goes through the Approval process. This status
   cannot be set manually.

   You can add custom statuses for which you need Admin rights. For
   example: you have a custom status called hold.

-  **Custom Tags**: These are additional tags that a Requester and
   Technicians can provide. This is a way to categorize a Request when
   default options are not enough. For example: you can add a tag
   Antivirus to all Requests related to antivirus renewal.

-  **Identified as Problem**: This label classifies the Request as
   having a related Problem. The Problems can be viewed in the
   **Relations** tab.

-  **Importance**: A Request can be categorized based on importance in
   the following ways:

   a. **Priority**: Setting this label shows the magnitude of the
      Request in the system. The Priority labels are system-defined. You
      can choose whether to set Priority manually or automatically using
      the Priority Matrix feature in Admin (refer Administration
      Manual).

   b. **Urgency**: Setting this label helps Technicians to ascertain the
      response time for the Request. These are predefined labels that
      are immutable, and they are Low, Medium, High, and Urgent.

   c. **Impact**: Setting this label shows where the Request has its
      effect which is either on User, Department or Business.

-  **Service Level Agreement**: SLA determines the Response Time and
   Resolution Time after considering Priority (others conditions in case
   of custom SLA). It also determines the escalated action when a time
   condition is violated. This generates the following data points about
   a Request.

   a. **SLA Status**: Tells whether any of the SLA conditions are
      violated or not.

   b. **Due-Date**: It reminds Technicians about the due date.

   c. **Estimated Time**: It tells the estimated time of resolution of
      the Request in minutes. A Technician can modify this, but it
      doesnâ€™t changes the SLA conditions.

   d. **Support Level**: All Technicians are grouped into four Tiers
      based on their expertise and experience. Setting this tag shows
      which Tier the Request belongs.

   e. **Escalation Level**: This is the number of times escalated
      actions were taken based on SLA.

-  **Place**: A request can be classified based on the associated
   physical locations which are:

   .. note:: Below both fields have predefined values (as a drop-down list)
             set by the Administrator.

   a. **Department**: If the Request is related to a particular
      department, then this field is set to that department. A
      Technician can manually set the department field if needed.

   b. **Location**: If the Request is related to a particular location,
      then this field is set to that location.

-  **Source**: It shows the medium used to create the Request. The field is 
    automatically set by the server based on how it was created. 
    For example: all Requests created via email have the source set to
    Email.

-  **Category**: It is the primary method to categorize the Request.
   :doc:`Learn More <introduction-request-management>`.

-  **Technician Group**: The product allows grouping of Technicians into
   groups. Setting this field shows which group the Request belongs.

-  **Approval Status**: This classifies the Request based on the
   Approval stage. Learn more about
   :ref:`Approval <rm-different-states-in-an-approval-process>`.

-  **Reopen Count**: This label shows how many times the Request has
   been opened after getting close. The tag appears when a Request gets
   reopened for the first time.

Linking Knowledge with a Request
================================

It is crucial for a Technician to resolve a Request as fast as possible,
which is why information is made available through Knowledge in the
:ref:`Details View <request-details-view>`.

You can use the Search Knowledge to perform a search of the Knowledge.
You could find related information which you can link it with the
Request.

Communication, Collaboration, and Resolution
============================================

Flotomate has functions that allow Technicians to gather information
through collaboration and communication and use it to resolve a Request.
The **Work** tab in the :ref:`Details View <request-details-view>` of a
Request has those functions.

.. _rmf-23:
.. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/request-management/RM-23.png

section is also referred to as Resolution section. In here you can
perform the following actions:

.. note:: Apart from Diagnosis, everything else is shown as part of a
          unified thread.

-  **Ask Requester**: You can directly communicate with the Requestor
   from the Details View using this option. Whatever you communicate
   gets added to a unified thread. The comments of the Requester also
   get added to the thread.

   The Requester gets an email notification on every message you post and vice-versa (Requestor and assigned Technician are the
   default recipients for email notification). The Requestor can reply to the emails and the replies are added to
   the comment thread.

   A Requestor can also comment in the Details View of a Request
   from the Customer Portal. Where he/she can specify a Technicianâ€™s
   name (other than the assigned Technician) as @tachnician_name in the 
   message body, and the mentioned Technician/Technicians get notified via email.

Custom Fields
=============

Custom fields are additional fields that appear on the Create a
Request form (both Technician and Customer Portal) and the
Details View of Requests. You can create such fields from the Admin
section.

A field can be made compulsory in a particular status. For example, we
created a field called employee ID and made it compulsory for the status
**Open**; so anyone changing Status from **Open** to any other has to
make sure the Employee ID is not empty.

Inputted values in the Custom field is shown in the :ref:`Details
View <request-details-view>` of a Request under Custom Fields tab.

.. _rm-asking-for-approval:

Asking for Approval
===================

This is an option a Technician assigned to a Request can utilize to seek
approvals from others before resolving or closing a Request. The
Approval process is a mechanism for control that ensures Technicians
donâ€™t commit unauthorized actions.

Custom rules, set by someone with Admin rights, decide whether taking
Approval is necessary or not before resolving or closing a Request.

Initiating an Approval
----------------------

.. note:: You need to be the assigned Technician in order to start the
          Approval process.

1. Go to the :ref:`Details View <request-details-view>` of a Request.

2. Scroll down to the **Approval** tab and click it.

.. _rmf-33:
.. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/request-management/RM-33.png
    :align: center
    :alt: figure 33

3. Click on **Ask for Approval** to initiate the Approval process.

Different States in an Approval Process
---------------------------------------

-  Approval Pending:

-  Approval Rejected:

-  Approval Approved:

Managing Approval
-----------------

An assigned Technician can view all his Approvals under the Approvals
tab. The Approvals tab shows two columns: the Approvals column which
lists all the Approvals along with their approvers, and the Comments
column that shows the message thread between Technicians and approvers.
Any Technician with the necessary rights can access the Approvals tab of
a Request.

.. _rmf-34:
.. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/request-management/RM-34.png
    :align: center
    :alt: figure 34

An assigned Technician can create multiple Approvals with the same
approvers or different ones. Between multiple Approvals, whether to go
with unanimous or majority can be set from **Admin** (A Navigation Tab)
>> **Approval Workflow** (Automation) >> **Approval Settings**, but the
rights to do it lies with the Super Admin.

.. _rmf-35:
.. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/request-management/RM-35.png
    :align: center
    :alt: figure 35

Approval Process
----------------

-  When an Approval process is initiated, first the system changes the
   Request status to **Pending in Approval** and then checks for
   available Approval Workflows. If there are no workflows, then the
   Request is pre-approved, and the Approval status is changed to
   **Pre-Approved** and Request status is changed to Pending on
   Technician. If there is a workflow, then based on its set conditions
   approver/approvers are auto-assigned for approval.

   .. note:: Refer to Administration Manual to know more about Approval
             Workflows.

-  You can view all the approvers, their statuses and comments in the
   Approvals tab.

    .. _rmf-36:
    .. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/request-management/RM-36.png
        :align: center
        :alt: figure 36

   Once an Approval is set, the Approval status of the Request changes to
   **Pending,** and it stays there as long as the approver/approvers donâ€™t
   express a decision.

-  An approver can see his Approvals in the **My Approvals** section of
   his account.

    .. _rmf-37:
    .. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/request-management/RM-37.png
        :align: center
        :alt: figure 37

   Clicking on **My Approvals** (:numref:`rmf-37`) opens the My Approval page
   where he can view his Approvals.

    .. _rmf-38:
    .. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/request-management/RM-38.png
        :align: center
        :alt: figure 38

   Clicking on a Request Approval in **My Approval** opens a page with the
   title of the Approval as the header title. There he can perform the
   following actions:

    .. _rmf-39:
    .. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/request-management/RM-39.png
        :align: center
        :alt: figure 39

    a. Review the details and comments on the Request.

    b. Start a comment thread which is visible to anyone having access to
       the comment section.

    c. Reject or Approve the Approval.

-  The outcome of an Approval process is decided in two ways:

    a. **Unanimous**: All of the Approvers have to approve else the
       Approval is rejected.

    b. **Majority**: If the majority of Approvers agree then Approval is
       successful.

-  On success, the Approval moves to the Approved status and the Request
   status changes to Pending on Technician. On failure, the Approval
   moves to the Rejected status and Request status changes to Pending on
   Technician; the assigned Technician has to reinitiate the Approval
   process.

.. _rmf-40:
.. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/request-management/RM-40.png
    :align: center
    :alt: figure 40

-  If a Technician has the right to ignore approvers (refer
   Administration Manual), then he can ignore non-responsive approvers
   and push the Approval towards the Approved stage. An ignored approver
   can see his status as Ignored in the Details View of the Request. An
   approver cannot see the Approvals where he/she was ignored in his/her
   **MY Approvals** section.

   Ignoring all the approvers in an Approval changes the Approval status
   to Approved. A Technician can ignore or reinitiate an Approval using
   the **Re-Approve** option where a duplicate Approval is created, and
   the original Approval is ignored. You can Re-Approve an already
   Approved Approval; in that case, you can manually set the Request
   status to Pending in Approval.

    :alt: figure 41

-  During an Approval process, the following things cannot happen:

   a. SLA cannot run during an Approval process. It stays paused still
      Approval is approved.

   b. Location, Category, and Department cannot be modified.

.. _rm-managing-task:
Managing Task
=============

Sometimes resolving a Request becomes a collaboration between multiple
Technicians; which is why the product allows delegation of tasks from
the Details View of a Request.

Any Technician can assign Tasks to other Technicians related to any
Request if he has manage Task rights. An assignee can see his Task/Tasks
on his Dashboard.

watch so that necessary actions are taken promptly. With the Watch

Their names are added by default whenever a technician creates a
Notification.
