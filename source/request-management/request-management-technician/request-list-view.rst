*****************
Request List View
*****************

The Request interface is divided into two parts: Request List View and
the Request Details View. The Request List View allows **Technicians**
to track and manage all Requests at one place.

In the Request List View, users get to see all the available Requests in
the system. It is the central hub for a Technician, where he/she finds a
Request and acts upon it.

To open Request List View:

1. Log in to Motadata through the Technician Portal.

2. Click on **Request** (A Navigation Tab) to open the Request List
   View, or you can hover your mouse over **Request**; you get a popup
   menu. Click on **All Open Request** to view the list of all the
   available Requests in the List View.

    a. :ref:`Classifiers <classify-requests>` (Status, Priority, Due Date and SLA Status)

    b. Assignee information or :doc:`Claim and Assign
       buttons <assigning-a-request>`. Next to them is the Action
       Menu having the following options:

        i.   Mark as Spam

        ii.  View Audit Trail

        iii. Open In New Window

    c. Requester info and Create time of the Request.

-  Section-G is the Glance pane that shows you some
   :ref:`classifiers <classify-requests>`. You also have two tabs:

    a. **Details**: It shows the Requester info and Create Time of the
       Request

    b. **Requestor Info**: Here the name and email address of the requestor is shown.    

    c. **Activity**: It shows the :doc:`Audit Trail <rm-viewing-audit-trail>`
       of the Request.

-  Section-H gives you the option to set the number of Requests visible
   per page; the highest is 100 per page.

   You can toggle between Grid view-mode and Table view-mode.

    a. In Grid view-mode, the listings are more descriptive and explicit
       compared to Table view-mode. You can view additional information in the
       Glance pane of a Request.

    b. Table view-mode is minimalist which shows minimum information. The
       focus is to give you the most critical information.
