Mark a Request as a Spam
************************

Irrelevant and unsolicited messages sent are Spam; here the messages are in the form of tickets (Requests). 
It may happen that some Requests that you receive are irrelevant, and
you want them to disappear. You can discard a Request as a Spam, and it
disappears from the main server. 

You can mark multiple Requests as Spam at once or mark them individually.
