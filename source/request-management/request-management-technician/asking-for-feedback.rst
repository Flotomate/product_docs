Asking for Feedback
*******************

Feedbacks are valuable information that helps in taking important decisions. 
Top performing companies are top performers because they consistently seek ways to make themselves better.
A Technician can ask a Requestor for feedback about his/her experience
with a Request. Such a feedback loop ensures continuous improvement in the way
services are delivered to the end user. 

In taking feedback, an email can be sent (by a Technician) with a link to the
feedback form and the sane link is also embedded in the notification emails sent
when a Request is resolved and closed.

**To activate feedback:**

-  Go to **Admin** >> **Request Feedback Settings** (under Request Management).

-  You can automatically send a feedback link to a Requestor in the
   following ways:

   a. **Resolving a Request**: If you toggle the Resolved button on, a
      feedback link is sent with the email notification on Resolving a
      Request.

   b. **Closing a Request**: If you toggle the Closed button on, a
      feedback link is sent with the email notification on Closing a
      Request.

-  If you turn **Send feedback manually** button on, then you can send a
   feedback link to a Requester from the Details View of a Request.

When a Requestor clicks on the feedback link he/she gets the following
form:

You can view the feedback of a Requestor in the Details View of a
Request, and the values captured via custom fields are separately shown under the Feedback tab.

**Things to Remember:**

- Requestor can submit multiple feedbacks.

- The star rating is based on the last submitted feedback.

Feedback Custom Fields
----------------------

A user can add additional fields on the feedback form (refer :numref:`rmf-66`). Custom fields help users to capture additional information.

To add Custom Fields:

- Go to Admin >> Feedback Custom Field (under Request Management).

- In the Custom Field page, create form using drag and drop using the pre-defined field types.
