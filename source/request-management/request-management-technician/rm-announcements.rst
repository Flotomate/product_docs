Announcements
*************

An announcement is a statement made to the public (Customers and
Technicians) or on a particular portal which gives information about
something that has happened or that will happen. For example: an
announcement can be made stating that the Helpdesk will be down for a
certain period.

You can run an Announcement on both Customer and Technician Portals.

5. The subject of an Announcement (section-A in :numref:`rmf-76`) is the first
   line of the message. It is supposed to give a brief introduction of
   the message.

   .. note:: All Announcements are visible to the Technicians on the
             Dashboard (under Announcement tab) in the Technician Portal.

   Section B highlights the Display options available on the dialog box,
   which are:

   date at a specific time and end on an end date at a specific time. In
