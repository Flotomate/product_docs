Requestor Accounts
******************

We have users who use our Helpdesk to serve their external clients from different organization. In such cases, it becomes important to track the source
of a request. With the Request Accounts feature, users of our product can bifurcate incoming Requests based on the organization
of the Requestor. Before using this feature, a user (with admin rights) has to manually add the client organizations in the product.

**Adding a Requestor Account**

- Go to Admin (A Navigation Tab) >> Request Accounts (under User).
