Technical Groups
****************

You can group Technicians into separate **Technician Groups.** It is a
way to classify Technicians; for example, people who work with databases
can be grouped into a Technician Group called Database. Thereâ€™s no limit
to the number of **Technician Groups** you can create.

Few use cases of having Technician Groups are:

-  You can associate a ticket (Request, Problem or Change) with a
   particular Technician Group; this tells the product/users that the
   ticket should be handled by a Technician of that group.

-  You can send notifications to a Technician Group regarding a ticket.

-  You can send an Announcement through email to a Technician Group.

-  Change in Technician Group of a Request can trigger an automatic
   process.

.. note:: You need to have administrative rights to view and modify Technician Group details.
