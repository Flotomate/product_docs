Technician Roles 
****************

Every Technician is different, so we have roles to give them different
rights and permissions. Each role is unique, and out of the box we have
seven roles in the system; you cannot modify the permissions and rights
of these roles. However, you can add custom roles where you can set the
permissions and rights; thereâ€™s no limit to the number of custom roles
that you can create.

Using Roles you can control the CRUD operations a Technician can perform
across the following modules:

-  Request

-  Problem

-  Change

-  Project

-  Patch

-  Knowledge

-  Asset

-  Admin

- Contract

- Purchase

- Report

- Dashboard

   clicking **Create a Role** situated in the top right corner of the page.
   We have the permissions and rights grouped module wise. Click any one
   module to see its rights and permissions.

-  Add a name to the role and a description. You can set the permissions
   and rights for every module.
