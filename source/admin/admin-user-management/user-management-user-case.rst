Ravi realizes that he has accidentally added Mohan as a Technician.
Again he goes to **Technicians** in Users. He finds Mohan and hits the
Delete icon adjacent to his name; he has successfully deleted Mohan from
the system.

He has another task to do. He needs to change the Roles of a Technician
name Naren. He quickly goes to the **Edit Technician** dialog box and
updates his role.

Ravi knows that all his technicians are not the same. He wants to group
them into different groups. Ravi remembers that Motadata offers
**Technician Groups**; he goes to **Technicians Groups** (Users) from
**Admin**. He quickly adds a database group name Database and adds Naren
and Amartya.

He can efficiently manage all the groups from the **Technician Groups**
page. Now he is confident that he has aligned his companyâ€™s resources to
meet its IT requirements.
