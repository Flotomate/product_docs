Proxy Server Configuration
**************************

If you want the product to have access to the internet, then you can
setup a proxy server or give the product direct access.

Some of the benefits of Proxy configured:

-  Control of patch downloading from update servers in Remote
   Deployment.

-  Protects the tool from direct access.

To configure Proxy Server:

-  Go to **Admin** >> **Proxy Server Configuration** (IT
   Infrastructure).
