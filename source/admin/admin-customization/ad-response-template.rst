Response Template
*****************

While handling Requests, Technicians have to do a lot of repetitive work. We have isolated two such work: asking Requestors and 
giving a Solution. You can now create templates to deliver canned response and solution to Requestors having similar problems.
You can create n number of templates and access them directly from Ask Requestor and Solution input box in a Request.

**To Create a Template:**

- Go to **Admin** (A Navigation Tab) >> **Response Template** (under Request Management).

- The Response Templates page opens. Here you can view all your existing templates. Click on **Create Response Template**
  situated in the top right corner of the page.

- A new page opens where you get the following fields:

    .. _ad-res-2:
    .. figure:: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/flotomate-resources/admin/ad-response+template/AD-RES-2.png

    a. Section A (:numref:`ad-res-2`) is where you give a name to the template.

    b. In section B, you decide where the template will be used. It can either be used while asking Requestors or giving a solution to
       a Request.

    c. There is a toggle button to turn on/off the template in section C.

    d. Section D is the text area to add your response.

    e. While writing your response , you can add placeholders from a predefined list which you can access from Section E.
       Placeholders can fetch specific data; for example, the placeholder {#Ticket Id#} fetches the ticket id of the Request 
       on which you are working.

    f. In section F you can also attach a file. The attache file will be used as part of the response.   

- Fill all necessary fields and click on **Create**. Your template is added to the Response Template page.
