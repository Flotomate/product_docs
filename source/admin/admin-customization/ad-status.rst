Status 
******

Status show the stage of a Request, Problem, Change, Project and an Asset in
their respective process flow. Statuses are essential in managing the
life-cycle of tickets, projects and CIs in Motadata. A lot of automatic
processes can be created based on the Status of a ticket/project/CI.

We have predefined Statuses for each of the ticket types, project and Asset.
Along with pre-defined Statuses, you can add custom Statuses.

.. note:: Setting Custom Status requires administrative rights.
