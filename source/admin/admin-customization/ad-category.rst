Add a Category

.. note:: Adding a category requires you to have access to the Admin section.

   Software)** **Categories**.

-  In Request, Problem, Change, and Project, you can add a Category and
   its Sub-Categories up to level three. In Software, you can have only
   standalone Categories.

-  In the leftmost column, you can add a level one Category using the
   **Add** button. Clicking on a Category activates its right side
   Sub-Category column where you can add another Category.

-  In Request, you are asked for a Category Key when adding a new
   Category. This is used as a prefix to the ID of a Request.
