Software Type
*************

A Software Type tries to define the nature of existence of a Software
Asset. By default, Motadata provides six Software Types out of the box.
They are as follows:

-  **Excluded**: These are all Software that does not need any managing.

-  **Managed**: These are all Software that needs managing with regards
   to License and Compliance.

-  **Freeware**: These are Software that is free to use.

-  **Prohibited**: These are Software that is not allowed to be used.

-  **Shareware**: These are Software that is running on a free Trial.

-  **Unidentified**: As the name suggests, these are unidentified
   Software with unknown source.
