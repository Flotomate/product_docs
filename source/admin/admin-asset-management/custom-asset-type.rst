Custom Asset Types
******************

We have introduced the concept of Asset Type Hierarchy to make
cataloging of Assets simple. It is a predefined catalog of Asset Types,
which serves the purpose of giving you a generic umbrella term for every
Asset in the CMDB.

Motadata allows you to add custom Asset Sub-Types in the Asset Type
Hierarchy. You can create sub-types up to two levels.

To add an Asset Type:

-  Go to **Admin** (A Navigation Tab) >> **Asset Types** (Asset
   Management).
