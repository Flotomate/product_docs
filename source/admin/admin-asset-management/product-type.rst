A Product can be further categorized into Product Types. A Product Type
is a generic category to group Products. For example, Router is a
Product Type that describes Products like Asus, TP-Link, etc. In
Motadata, you get a list of Product Types out of the box, but you can
also add more types.

**To Add a Product Type:**

1. Go to **Admin** (A Navigation Tab) >> **Product Types** (Asset
   Management).

3. You see the Add Product Type dialog box. You have to fill the
   following fields:
   
    a. **Name**: Type an appropriate Type name. For example, Desktop is
       a proper Product Type name.

    b. **Type**: It is a subdivision of a Product Type. There are four
       main Types to choose from:

        i.  **Asset**: It is a thing that can provide value
            generally for more than a year. For example, a Laptop
            computer.

        ii. **Component**: It refers to a functional part of an
            Asset. For example, a GPU card is a component that goes
            into a Desktop.

        iii. **Consumable**: It is a thing whose ability to deliver
             value gets exhausted within a short period, generally
             less than a year. For example, a Printer’s toner
             cartridge.

        iv.  **Others**: Anything that doesn’t fall in the above
             three Types.

    c. **Category**: Here you have to make a selection between an IT and
       Non-IT Asset. Learn :doc:`the difference between an IT and Non-IT Asset <asset-management-intro>`.
