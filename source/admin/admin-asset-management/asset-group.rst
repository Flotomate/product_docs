Flotomate allows you to categorize Assets in the CMDB into groups.
Groups are a convenient way to compartmentalize Assets based on certain
similarities.

Some of the benefits of using Asset Groups are:

-  Asset Groups help Technicians to manage Assets in the CMDB. For
   example: if a Technician is responsible for an Asset Group called
   DATA CENTER ASSETS then he can easily search for the Assets with the
   group name.

-  Groups are used in Hardware Asset notification. For example: in case
   there is a Hardware change in a specific Asset Group then a
   notification is sent to certain users.

**To Create an Asset Group:**

.. note:: This operation requires Admin rights.

1. Go to **Admin** >> **Asset Group** (Asset Management)

   their Assets.
