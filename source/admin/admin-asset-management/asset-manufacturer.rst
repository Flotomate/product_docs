.. _Adding a Manufacturer:

******************
Asset Manufacturer
******************

Before adding a Manufacturer’s name to a Product, you have to add it in
Flotomate. In Flotomate you can maintain a list of manufacturers’ names
that you can associate with various Products in the system.

To Add a Manufacturer:

1. Go to **Admin** (A Navigation Tab) >> **Manufacturers** (Asset
   Management).

2. The Manufacturers page opens. Here you can view all the
   Manufacturers that you have added. Click on **Add Manufacturer**
   situated in the top right corner of the page.

3. The Add Manufacturer dialog box opens. Type in the Name of the
   Manufacturer and a Description, and you can maintain a record of
   sysOIDs (System OID) using the **ADD System OID** (:numref:`adf-142`)
   button.

   The sysOID is for SNMP devices. The product matches SNMP devices
   with Manufacturers using the sysOID. The first 12 characters of a
   sysOID gives enough information to perform the match. The
   matchmaking happens even when the manufacturer is not explicitly
   mentioned in a SNMP device.

4. When you are done, hit **Save** to add the Manufacturer.

**Editing Manufacturer**

1. Go to **Admin** >> **Manufacturers**.

2. In the Manufacturers page, click on the Edit Icon adjacent to the
   Manufacturer that you want to edit.

3. Perform your edits in the Edit Manufacturer dialog box and hit
   **Update**.
