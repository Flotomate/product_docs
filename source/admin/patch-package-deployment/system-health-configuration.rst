Patch Management ensures that all administered IT Assets are updated
with the latest Patch from the Software Vendor; this enhances security
and helps in thwarting external and internal cyber-attacks.

Computers fetch and deploy Patches. So it becomes imperative to monitor
all Computers to keep yourself aligned with the idea of Patch
Management.

Our product has a feature called System Health that flags Computers that
are missing critical, essential Patches. This helps you to manage your
vulnerability and prevent any attacks.
