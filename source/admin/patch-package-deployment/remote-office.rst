Remote Office 
*************

Modern organizations are geographically dispersed. They have offices at different locations all controlled from a main office. Offices that are
away from the main office are termed as Remote Offices. It may happen that all the offices of an organization form part of a single 
network. Individual offices may have a relay server: A relay server is used to allow communications from outside a company's firewall 
to the internal Servers.  

In order to accommodate such situations, we have the following Remote Automation features:

- A user can create a group of computers for a location and save it as a Remote Office. 

- A user can add a Remote Office in a scope (Endpoint Scope) instead of individual computers for Patch/Package/Registry Management.

- Users can point a Remote Office to a relay Server. This is useful when there are multiple offices, and the admin doesn't want them
  to hog the central :ref:`File Server <File Server Installation Guide>` for Patch/Package download. This is why we have the feature that allows a Remote Office to download Patches/Packages from a 
  Relay Server rather than the central File Server.
